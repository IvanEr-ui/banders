This partnership emphasizes the importance of accurate and reliable oracles, as showcased by RedStone’s implementation of Angle’s tokenized asset, the Amundi ETF.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What’s Angle Protocol?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Angle is a decentralized, capital-efficient and over-collateralized stablecoin protocol composed of smart contracts running on open blockchains. It can be used to issue stablecoins designed to mirror the value of an asset they are pegged to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The protocol consists of several different modules, or sets of smart contracts, from which stablecoins can be issued or minted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>agEUR is supported by an innovative price stability module called the Transmuter: the Transmuter introduces minting and redemption mechanisms that centers safety and resilience thanks to automated controls of exposures to assets and fair redemptions in case of black-swan events. Angle also deployed a Borrowing module allowing to borrow agEUR against various crypto assets deposited as collateral.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The protocol is also engaged in Direct Deposit Modules, also called Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs), allowing it to bootstrap liquidity for agTokens in other protocols.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Angle’s Oracle Needs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After publishing RedStone’s proposal on the governance forum and successfully passing voting with 100% of participants in favour, the RedStone team started to work on an integration with Angle team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Angle’s infrastructure has always been tied to oracles’ availability and reliability. In this specific case, there was a voted plan to diversify agEUR’s backing with tokenized ETF relating to short-term Euro bonds – the bC3M. Implementing this naturally required oracles to price this asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Implemented Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the rapidly evolving world of DeFi, integrating real-world assets and ensuring their accurate representation on the blockchain is paramount. One of the prime examples of Redstone’s capabilities is its daily price feed for an ETF of short-term (0-6 Months) Euro treasury bonds, an esteemed real-world asset.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In collaboration with Angle, Redstone refreshes the price of this asset around noon daily, ensuring that DeFi platforms and their users have access to up-to-date, reliable data. This consistent and timely price update is essential for various DeFi activities, ranging from trading, and lending, to collateralization. Interested parties can further verify and view the current prices delivered by the Redstone oracle on the Ethereum blockchain via the smart contract hosted <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x6E27A25999B3C665E44D903B2139F5a4Be2B6C26#readProxyContract\">here</a>. As the DeFi sector continues to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems, collaborations like the one between Angle and Redstone offer a promising glimpse into the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What’s next for RedStone and Angle?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Plans to use tokenized off-chain assets such as the bC3M in Defi have been heavily discussed and called for. RedStone is an enabler by being reactive and responsive to demands in the ecosystem. Moving forward, the synergy between RedStone’s oracle solutions and Angle’s robust protocol infrastructure promises to pave the way for broader asset integrations. This collaboration signifies a dynamic shift, aiming to create a more inclusive, efficient, and diversified DeFi landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The ability to deliver an oracle for a tokenized asset that differs from the standard crypto assets regularly priced in Defi expands possibilities for many protocols including Angle.” says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheBlockAdopter\">Mariam Kouanda</a>, Head of Business Development and Marketing at Angle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>About RedStone</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone is revolutionizing the Oracles industry by implementing novel modular design and 3 tailor-made data consumption models.

Being EVM-compatible means all the contracts and tools that work on Ethereum also work on Mantle Network with minimal modifications. Users can experiment with exciting web3 apps, and developers can deploy smart contracts in an efficient, low-fee environment. Mantle Network was developed by BitDAO (now rebranded to Mantle) which has <a href=\"https://defillama.com/treasuries\">the biggest DAO treasury</a> in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mantle began the year with a highly-anticipated testnet launch on Jan. 10, 2023. Since the launch of Mantle Testnet, it has achieved:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Total Transaction Count</strong> &gt; 2,800,000<br><strong>Unique Smart Contracts</strong> &gt; 33,000<br><strong>Unique addresses that have deployed contracts</strong> &gt; 22,000</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More on this in the <a href=\"https://medium.com/0xmantle/mantle-milestones-q1-2023-in-a-gist-668eb09a9e7d\">roadmap summary</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Mantle Token $MNT</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mantle token will power Mantle Network as its native gas token, data availability (DA) node staking token, and ecosystem growth token. All future Mantle products will likewise be powered by Mantle token, as it continues to serve as the governance token of Mantle Governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Mantle x RedStone Integration</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mantle.xyz/\">Mantle</a> is an EVM-compatible blockchain, so integration with RedStone oracles was fairly easy. Our library evm-connector which is in line with <a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-core\">RedStone Core Model</a> tested on many other chains where data is dynamically injected into user transactions providing gas efficiency and a great user experience. To be sure that everything works fine we deployed a test contract on Mantle extended by our data consumer contract which is required to verify data correctness. An example contract receives price data from the evm-connector framework, extracts it and then returns it as the transaction to the chain is successful. This gives us the certainty that the transaction send has proper information about prices and that integration with Mantle is working. Thanks to that any protocol is able to start using RedStone oracles on Mantle and build superb products.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“We’re thrilled to welcome Redstone into Mantle Ecosystem and introduce more reliable and seamless oracle integrations on our network, so developers get access to more tools that’ll empower their builds,” </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArjunKalsy\">Arjun Kalsy</a>, Head of Ecosystem at Mantle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Why It’s So Important and What’s Next?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The integration of RedStone Oracles into the Mantle Ecosystem unlocks a wealth of new features and opportunities, particularly for the DeFi sector within Mantle ecosystem. The hyper scale performance – low fees and faster finality align seamlessly with RedStone’s vision for ultra-low latency on-demand Oracles, making real-time, accurate data available for smart contracts. Oracles are critical for the development of DeFi applications such as lending platforms, derivatives, options, and perpetuals, providing reliable and timely data necessary for their functioning. In essence, this integration is a major step towards a more efficient, transparent, and inclusive DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>How Can I Start Building?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t forget that Mantle Network offers a Grants Program that provides milestone-based funding to promising projects that help expand, secure, and decentralize the network and the wider ecosystem. To support the next generation of innovators, builders, and developers, Mantle is growing its ecosystem via Mantle EcoFund, which helps to manage a catalyzed capital pool of $200M.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>About RedStone</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone is revolutionizing the Oracles industry by implementing novel modular design and 3 tailor-made data consumption models.

Venus simplified the user experience and provided core capabilities that enabled decentralized finance to flourish in a single application by combining the stablecoin minting facility introduced by Maker and algorithmic money markets developed by Compound. As a result, Venus found remarkable success and quickly rose to be one of the most widely used decentralized applications in web3 currently boasting $1.4 Billion in TVL (as of 12th July 2023).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest iteration of Venus Protocol builds on prior successes and lessons learned to improve in 3 key areas:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Risk management</li><li>Decentralization</li><li>User experience</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In doing so, Venus continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible within the realm of decentralized finance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0Hy76mYjcIw9KYIJ8mgMcynhQ7_ls1LmxgMrsnT1cBbpIewWEIxPqeIA9iEaCIaxFaNa4ICJ9-YHhUHYGk6rG_yFP08NZ1pbfu2xbRtwrnO6zXPdRNRL-smw_po29dGIpuvuTYVXwhKfBrOzNTYaWrA\" alt=\"\" width=\"668\" height=\"462\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>                                             High-level flow of the Venus protocol.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Venus’ Oracle Needs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://venus.io/\">Venus</a> has been on a mission to be the most secure protocol in regards to Oracles since it <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-protocols-declare-losses-as-attackers-exploit-luna-price-feed-discrepancy\">suffered over $11M loss</a> with Chainlink pause of LUNA oracle. Therefore, adding RedStone to Venus’ Resilient Oracle module operating on the BNB Chain is a crucial step in adding redundancy to the design. As a result, users of Venus are best protected against Black Swan events in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeFi has relied on Chainlink, which became a single price feed oracle provider, which posed a systematic risk to the whole industry. This architecture meant when things go wrong, they can go catastrophically. The limitation they encountered from other oracles was an unfamiliar interface making it hard to consolidate price feeds from Oracles and the necessity to run part of Oracles infrastructure with some of the providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone not only adjusted its Classic model to the Resilient Oracle module interface so it can be plugged into seamlessly but also takes care of running its price feeds infrastructure end-to-end, together with the on-chain relayer, ensuring Venus’s highest security standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Implemented Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, our team had a technical discussion with the Venus DEV team to understand their needs and preferred configuration. Venus’ contributors admitted that the <a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-core\">RedStone Core</a> model will be the best fit in the long term, but in the current architecture, <a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-classic\">RedStone Classic</a> is compatible with Venus’s oracle interface, as no changes to the code logic are required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Redstone Classic extends the core functionality of providing signed price feeds with a network of relayer nodes that push the data on-chain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Additionally, RedStone Classic comes with a few crucial characteristics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Venus can customize parameters of updated Heartbeat and Deviation Threshold,</li><li>Full transparency in terms of chosen Data Sources and Data Aggregation methods,</li><li>RedStone takes care of the end2end infrastructure maintenance and development.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After publishing <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/adding-redstone-oracles-to-the-venus-oracle-interface/3620\">RedStone’s proposal</a> on the governance forum and successfully <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/venus-xvs.eth/proposal/0xa9cb9de5934ef245bbbdfde5badfd2f5128879417ffada1278e96231e3f09818\">passing voting</a> with 100% participants in favour, RedStone team prepared an on-chain relayer on BNB Chain with a monitoring service for Venus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What’s next for RedStone and Venus?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to adding RedStone to the Oracle module to Venus V4, the dApp will be able to spin new isolated markets easily, utilising RedStone price feeds in the future, i.e. for GHO (Aave’s stablecoin), BNB Chain available LSTs or even RWA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Exclusive Interview with Venus Team</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our speaker was Danny, BD and Community Lead at Venus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Can you explain why RedStone’s support of Venus’ Oracle module is important?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong><br></strong>First and foremost, it enhances the overall functionality and reliability of the Venus ecosystem. With RedStone’s advanced Oracle infrastructure, users can trust the accuracy and timeliness of the data provided for new price feeds.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.

Previously, CIAN faced challenges with conventional oracles, including high latency and potential price discrepancies. However, with RedStone’s Core (aka Pull or On-Demand) model integration, CIANnow benefits from reduced latency and accurate price feeds. This seamless integration has improved the reliability and efficiency of their LST strategies, safeguarding users’ assets and enhancing overall performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What’s CIAN Protocol?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cian.app/\">CIAN</a> is a decentralized automation platform that helps users earn from DeFi yield opportunities safely and efficiently. The main thrust of CIAN’s operations centres on yield opportunities connected with liquid staking tokens (LST, alternatively referred to as LSD).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform empowers users to architect, oversee, and optimize strategies across multiple protocols using a diverse range of cryptocurrencies. This includes popular choices such as BTC, ETH, many Stablecoins, and mainstream liquid staking tokens like wstETH, rETH, MaticX, and sAVAX. This level of versatility provided by CIAN ensures that users have an extensive range of options for managing their crypto assets and maximizing their investment returns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>CIAN’s Oracle Needs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CIAN faced challenges with conventional oracles, which introduce high latency and potential price discrepancies. Adopting a conventional oracle in CIAN’s design would require additional complex mechanisms to address price inaccuracies, resulting in increased gas consumption. To overcome these limitations, integrating RedStone offered a solution with reduced latency and accurate price feeds. This integration enhances the reliability and efficiency of CIAN’s strategy vaults, safeguarding users’ assets and improving overall performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Implemented Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After we had analysed the needs of the CIAN team we decided to propose our “<a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-core\">Core Model</a>”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this setup, CIAN can consume multiple feeds at a very low latency in an efficient way, where gas costs are only charged when the data is used. Thanks to our automatic mechanism of injecting the feeds to user payload the solution could be used without changing smart-contracts interfaces.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, all the feeds in the “Core Model” are accessible on any EVM-compatible chain allowing CIAN to quickly expand to new ecosystems in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>CIAN Team Exclusive Interview</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our speaker is Luffy, the Founder of <a href=\"https://cian.app/\">CIAN</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Can you describe your initial oracle problem in a few sentences?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Despite the maturity, conventional oracles provide a high latency solution where the oracle feed price could differ significantly from the market price. Although this might be tolerable in many use cases, in certain use cases, this could lead to a large detriment to users’ assets. To adopt a conventional oracle in CIAN’sdesign, CIAN needs to devise an extra complicated mechanism to alleviate the price inaccuracy, which is also gas-consuming.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. What are the exact obstacles and limitations you encountered?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When selecting the Oracle for CIAN’s strategy vaults, we consider a vector of aspects – reliability, level of decentralization, EVM compatibility, and most importantly price latency. RedStone stands out in virtually all these aspects while providing close to real-time price feeding. This allows CIAN to provide the maximum capital efficiency to their users.<br></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Why have you decided to integrate RedStone?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The integration is neat and almost hassle-less, we did not need to modify the abi of our smart contracts to cope with the Redstone oracle, just to import SDK and javascript payloads.

The integration allows institutional parties to engage with the decentralized protocols, such as the blue-chip Aave Protocol or Voltz, the leading interest rate swap AMM, in a customized environment adjusted to corporate requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">What are Avalanche Subnets?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Avalanche Subnets are customized blockchains within the Avalanche platform that inherit consensus from the platform. They allow for unique configurations including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Different validator sets,&nbsp;</li><li>Custom gas token, configuration and fees distribution,&nbsp;</li><li>Privacy options like support for users KYC/KYB and,</li><li>Capability to use custom VMs on a Subnet.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Avalanche Subnets support diverse use cases and interoperability, facilitating the creation of private or consortium chains within a unified ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Evergreen &amp; Spruce: Web3 heaven for institutions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/avalancheavax/avalanche-launches-evergreen-subnets-for-institutional-blockchain-deployments-8cb75cfcc151\">Avalanche Evergreen Subnets</a> are a suite of institutional blockchain deployments, customizations and tooling designed to address company-specific and industry-wide requirements for financial services. Crucially, we believe that the Evergreen Subnets maintain the benefits of public network development while enabling particular features historically only possible within enterprise solutions, like interacting with known and approved counterparties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key component in making Evergreen suitable chains for traditional finance (TradFi) organizations is their ability to implement customer and counterparty credentials and permissioning at the chain level of the tech stack. This allows institutions to continue addressing and managing requirements around KYC, KYB, investor suitability, etc., within their respective on-chain applications and ecosystems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, the Spruce Testnet is a controlled environment that lets traditional buy- and sell-side institutions engage with public blockchain infrastructure and bluechip DeFi applications in a low risk, low barrier-to-entry way and test the possibilities of on-chain finance (OnFi).</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“The deployment of an Aave pool on Spruce Testnet is a strategic initiative that demonstrates the commitment to fostering institutional engagement within DeFi, which brings transparency, security and decentralization,”&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>said <strong>Stani Kulechov, Aave Companies Founder and CEO.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">RedStone adjusting to dApps’ needs in Classic model and familiar interface</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone <a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-classic\">Classic Oracle model</a> provides a customizable solution that adapts to the specific needs of dApps, <strong>including customizable Heartbeat and Deviation Threshold parameters.</strong> Furthermore, its familiar Oracle interface creates a seamless integration with existing smart contract codes, enabling effortless deployment on EVM environments, as demonstrated by Aave’s seamless launch on the Spruce testnet. This flexibility recently extended to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi/status/1661683795886579713?s=20\">Voltz’s launch</a> on Avalanche’s C-Chain, utilizing RedStone’s data feed for the critical interbank lending benchmark, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). Yet another example of how RedStone’s adaptability continues to bridge traditional finance and DeFi.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Traditional finance has long been trying to interact with private blockchains with very little result. Avalanche’s Spruce Subnet starts a new chapter, and RedStone is proud to deliver data feeds to the Testnet, opening a dedicated bridge between TradFi and DeFi blue-chip dApps like Aave Protocol,”&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>said <strong>Marcin Kazmierczak, RedStone Co-Founder &amp; COO</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Spruce &amp; DeFi combination potential</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Reputable global financial entities have already<a href=\"https://medium.com/avalancheavax/financial-institutions-join-avalanche-evergreen-subnet-spruce-to-drive-on-chain-finance-99686b715a55\"> begun their journey with Spruce</a>, recognizing its potential to create an effective entry point into the on-chain arena. The Spruce Testnet offers a tailor-made environment to engage with blockchain technology, bolstered by RedStone’s customizable data feeds. <strong>By delivering essential feeds like </strong><a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/IB01.L\"><strong>IB01</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/EUR\"><strong>Forex</strong></a><strong>, RedStone is equipped to launch additional data feeds as needed</strong>, reinforcing the potential of Spruce to attract additional institutional involvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“As institutions increasingly appreciate the revolutionary capabilities of blockchain technology, the Spruce testnet reaps the benefits of public blockchain development and the latest in DeFi innovation in a controlled environment conducive for on-chain examination and experimentation.

The final decision to migrate this integration to the Mainnet lies with the Aave Governance Forum, which would need to vote on a proposal to maintain a safe and secure launch within the ecosystem. In the meantime, RedStone stays in close contact with Avalanche about future needs and potential steps in this collaborative journey. For example, institutions request new TradFi-related feeds on Spruce, such as SOFR equivalent for EUR (€STR) and GBP (SONIA). The focus remains on conscious expansion and exploration, opening new avenues for OnFi.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">About RedStone</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone is revolutionizing the Oracles industry by implementing novel modular design and 3 tailor-made data consumption models.

When you stake with Lido, your tokens retain liquidity, enabling you to utilize them across various DeFi applications and garner additional rewards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lido, as the leading liquid staking solution, not only provides a seamless method to earn rewards on your digital assets but also distinguishes itself as the largest DeFi protocol by TVL with<a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/lido\"> $14.9 Billion locked as of July 2023.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s noteworthy that the most widely staked asset in the protocol is ETH, which is staked for stETH. Herein lies the mechanics of the protocol: when you stake with Lido, your tokens, especially ETH, retain their liquidity, enabling you to deploy them across a spectrum of DeFi applications, all while earning additional rewards. This unique functionality has propelled Lido to its leading status in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Staking pool. Protocol to manage deposits, staking rewards, and withdrawals. A separate one for every supported network.</li><li>st[token]. Unlike staked tokens, the Lido st[token] is freely transferable instead of locked as in the case of native staking.

They’re dedicated staking providers who can ensure the safety of funds belonging to the protocol users and the correctness of validator operations.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is stETH?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>stETH is a rebaseable ERC-20 token that represents ether staked with Lido. Unlike ether that is staked while running an Ethereum validator, stETH is liquid and can be transferred, traded, or used in DeFi applications in many forms, i.e. as collateral. The total supply of stETH reflects the amount of ether deposited into the protocol combined with staking rewards, minus potential validator penalties. stETH tokens are minted upon ether deposit at a 1:1 ratio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since withdrawals from the Beacon chain have been introduced <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LidoFinance/status/1658195237280284678\">on 15th May 2023</a>, it is also possible to redeem ether by burning stETH at the same 1:1 ratio (in rare cases it won’t preserve the 1:1 ratio though).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These scenarios are typically associated with potential penalties in the Ethereum 2.0 network. For instance, if a validator behaves maliciously or fails to maintain their online status, they may be penalized by having some of their staked ETH slashed. This slashing affects the total pool of staked ETH, which in turn could impact the 1:1 ratio of stETH to ETH, as the total value of stETH could be reduced relative to ETH.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1:1 ratio could be also affected by the lag between real-time changes on the Beacon chain and the updates on Lido’s side. Any discrepancies might affect the exchange rate momentarily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>stETH does not strictly comply with ERC-20. The only exception is that it does not emit Transfer() on rebase as <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#events\">ERC-20</a> standard recommends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result of this deviation is that token balances of stETH are not typically updated in real-time in wallets or on blockchain explorers that rely on Transfer() events to track token balances. This means that after a rebase, your stETH balance might not immediately reflect the new total until a transaction involving your stETH occurs or the interface you are using updates the balance manually.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zNKVDSjCY6BnMEvapK4zPDYsTePXdd1uNZlPEn6h1drNfwsjnvHj1MdgA9KhPMzmuhiZtEZ6OB2r2BHMbxdS0aQqx_6i5KdcWFCykj6JAtnhjNLujG-nkMSEEqbFO2XqWxk4kD37BokQJE-wfjBXcvI\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Screen from <a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/STETH\">stETH feed</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why does stETH need Oracle price feed?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The stETH token necessitates the use of an Oracle price feed to accurately represent its value in the DeFi space. Due to the increasing staking rewards, the amount of stETH on holders wallet isn’t fixed but grows over time. Additionally, stETH price fluctuates, usually following ETH price. But sometimes stETH trades at a discount and sometimes at premium against ETH (depends on market risk perception and validators penalties). An external Oracle price feed, such as RedStone’s, updates the price regularly, ensuring the real-time representation of stETH’s value. This accurate representation is pivotal for DeFi protocols such as <a href=\"https://www.raft.fi/\">Raft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gravitaprotocol.com/\">Gravita</a>, <a href=\"https://cian.app/\">CIAN</a> and <a href=\"https://aave.com/\">Aave</a>, which rely on these feeds for a variety of financial operations including trading, lending, and yield optimization. In this context, the Oracle price feed plays a critical role in providing a transparent, efficient, and market value of stETH, enabling these DeFi platforms to securely integrate and utilize stETH.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“”RedStone is an important enabler of stETH-based DeFi expansion – as projects can integrate stETH in various consumption versions, tailored to their needs.

In order to get the most reliable data we used information from multiple sources including DEXes (Curve, Uniswap), CEXes (Huobi, Bybit, Bitget), and aggregators (KAIKO, Coinmarketcap, Coingecko). The price data is aggregated through the median, signed and broadcasted to the Data Distribution Layer (DDL) by our nodes. Anyone can fetch the signed data from DDL and use it in smart contracts thanks to our <a href=\"http://Screen from stETH feed\">evm-connector library</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>stETH Integration Guide</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to integrate stETH is to use our <a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-core\">Core model</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@redstone-finance/evm-connector\">evm-connector library</a> which makes it super easy to fetch signed data from DDL and use it in smart contracts. All you need to do is extend your contract with our method, e.g., `MainDemoConsumerBase` which provides the functionality to verify signatures and parse prices from call data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing you have to do is use the evm-connector library on the client side to wrap the contract instance in order to pass proper token information to call data when interacting with the contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Future of Lido-RedStone Oracles Collaboration</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi/status/1661024722690379778?s=20\">announced an Angel Round from top Web3 builders in May 2023</a> where <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Justin_Stables\">Justin</a> (Investor and Contributor to the Lido DAO) and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chaingenius\">Jacob</a> (Head of BD at Lido) were angel investors, demonstrating their firm belief in RedStone’s vision and technical prowess. Their involvement underlines a steadfast commitment to a symbiotic relationship, reinforcing the notion that RedStone is on a path to significantly impact the digital asset ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone’s innovative offerings span 3 models, all of which are compatible with EVM-supported Layer 1 &amp; Layer 2 chains such as Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, and BNB. As ecosystems like zkSync Era, Linea, Mantle, and Scroll gain momentum, RedStone’s models are all set to extend their reach. The stETH price feed, once bridged, can be used across these platforms, paving the way for wider adoption and increased liquidity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, RedStone is pushing boundaries by cooperating with CIAN and exploring potential collaborations with Gravita to jointly debut on the zkSync Era. This strategic move aims to maximize the utilization of RedStone’s price feeds and contribute to the scalability and interoperability of DeFi ecosystems across multiple blockchains.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Exclusive Interview with Lido Team</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our speaker was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MacroMate8?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Seraphim Czecker</a>, DeFi Expansionist at Lido.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Can you explain, why RedStone’s support of stETH is important for Lido?</strong><strong><br></strong>Lido allows to stake ether without the need to have 32 ether and run the full validation set. On top of that, once users receive stETH, you can preserve the utility across DeFi by LPing it, using it as collateral etc. Here RedStone’s price feed for stETH plays a fundamental role in external protocols being able to price the token correctly as collateral or in other DeFi contexts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Why do you believe that RedStone is a valuable Oracle partner?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone goes the extra mile to meet protocols’ expectations towards price feeds. What I mean is that consumers of the stETH price feed can implement it in 3 dedicated models and also ask for some custom adjustments that is possible thanks to RedStone’s modular architecture. Combined with a dedicated team of builders make you guys a solid Oracle partner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. What are the current limitations of using stETH cross-chain? How and when do you plan to address it?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, stETH is available on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum, but that list is likely to grow in the coming months as more on more L2s and L1s seek to integrate stETH as an asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>About RedStone</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone is revolutionizing the Oracles industry by implementing novel modular design and 3 tailor-made data consumption models.

Swell enables users to generate passive income by staking ETH, earning blockchain rewards, and obtaining a yield-bearing liquid staking token (LST). Users can either hold this LST or engage with the broader DeFi ecosystem to earn extra yield.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What is swETH?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When a user stakes their ETH to the Swell swETH contract, the ETH equivalent in Swell’s liquid staking token swETH is minted to the user. The ETH in the swETH contract is sent to the Deposit manager contract to be pooled until there is enough for at least a 32 ETH deposit. The next validator(s) in the registry contract is then selected via round robin and a deposit is made into the Ethereum deposit contract with a validator key(s). The validator is then in a queue to be activated in the consensus layer for the node operator to begin attesting transactions and proposing blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VOUokDgCkuvrbFlAYFYmojBknMz7bQcFgpkjT67dUCl8Pa2_cEr_5b7tWaikDOxW_BSs7iJ4vf5KEGnI2N46h4ARU-KMMjTt5So-L8Kf3bcAYuq7hksJmsWv6ewut_bQkLA9CP2megQwQN7-50QpJPc\" alt=\"\" width=\"877\" height=\"580\"><figcaption>swETH mechanics</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Swell’s swETH is not a rebasing token.

Today, GMX and RedStone launch a cooperation around the early adoption of GMX V2 LP tokens as collateral by DeFi protocols. The aim is to add additional value to the new V2 version of the leading perps exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What are GMX and GLP?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gmx.io/\">GMX</a> is a leading permissionless decentralized perpetual exchange on Arbitrum and Avalanche. Traders on the exchange benefit from deep liquidity reduced liquidation risks and transparent pricing. GMX has worked collaboratively to create a robust ecosystem on both blockchains it’s deployed on, sporting over 100 DeFi integrations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With GMX V2 – currently on Testnet, and launching soon – any asset with a Chainlink price feed can be transacted efficiently on the exchange. Additionally, order execution is virtually guaranteed and fees are lowered, further optimizing the on-chain trading experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GLP is GMX’s multi-asset liquidity pool,&nbsp; which facilitates all swaps and leverage trading in V1 of the protocol. All liquidity in GLP is user-contributed; there are no external market makers involved. You can mint GLP tokens with any index asset and redeem your GLP for any index asset. The minting and redemption prices depend on the total worth of assets in the index, including profits and losses from open positions, divided by the GLP supply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Arbitrum, GLP token holders receive 70% of platform fees in ETH and on Avalanche, GLP token holders receive the same share of protocol fees in AVAX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>DeltaPrime leverages the growth of GMX with GLP feed</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GMX is Avalanche’s main perpetual futures platform. Its TVL has grown immensely over the past 18 months. This is mainly because the exchange is easy to use and caters to the needs of all traders and investors, no matter the amount of risk they want to take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super risky? Take anywhere between 1x – 50x leverage on your trades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not so risky? Provide liquidity through minting the GLP token. In doing so, you are holding a basket of AVAX, ETH, BTC and ~50% stablecoins, while simultaneously earning 70% of the protocol fees GMX earns on Avalanche!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On DeltaPrime, you can use your GLP as collateral to borrow against: a significant innovation. Additionally, you can mint it straight from your Prime Account, fully cross-margin.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TNIsiCZH0lBEoM2do5gtfad0-sm8yQC2Z4VdzVa6lqmkdhG_4Ule26GMwDpQxSqrvQ9Ll3ql7IlpOSh4cn9TTfs3FVhrU4GVhPg-JFiFniUUtRlzTVX6BeKVYwUFWBHAguX5qkDmJVyyUa_yo6gIBc8\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>DeltaPrime Dashboard</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What are the benefits of investing in GLP through DeltaPrime?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Deposit GLP into DeltaPrime and borrow against your GLP.</li><li>Mint GLP against (LP-)tokens in your Prime Account.</li><li>Farm multiplied GLP with partners like Yield Yak within your Prime Account.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“RedStone has been a valuable partner in growing usage of GLP as a collateral asset within DeFi, their integration with DeltaPrime is a perfect use case here.

The precision of the data is of utmost importance here. Without it, the collateral price would not be represented accurately, which could put DeltaPrime’s liquidity providers’ money at risk. To avoid deficient debt creation, based on RedStone’s pricing data, Delta Prime calculates Health Score – a parameter which tells the protocol when to liquidate its user’s positions and give the tokens back to its LPs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-x\">RedStone X model</a> is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of oracle data feeds.

This means it needs constant Oracle updates about the value of every single token for the Prime Accounts. Thanks to an off-chain stream of nodes called the “<a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/how-it-works#data-flow\">RedStone Data Access Layer</a>”, there is no need to pay gas costs for new price data, as the data is being pushed on-chain only when it’s needed (i.e for a liquidation). By offering more customisable flows of consuming data, RedStone Oracles can disrupt the industry, enabling the formation of completely new DeFi products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What is DeltaPrime?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://deltaprime.io/\">DeltaPrime</a> is the first Avalanche-native protocol that provides undercollateralized DeFi loans, in a trustless way. This means that, while you can borrow more than you deposit as collateral, depositors’ funds remain fully protected by the protection of liquidation bots. Users can easily deposit and borrow funds to increase the power of their usual DeFi investments. The minimum collateral ratio for these loans is 20%, allowing users to increase the potential returns of their trades and investments up to 5x.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>DeltaPrime’s Oracle Problem</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of DeltaPrime’s business model is the sophisticated evaluation of its borrowers’ portfolios to ensure solvency. These portfolios span across a variety of assets, from basic ERC20 tokens like ETH <strong>to more nuanced positions in liquidity-providing (AMM), vaults, and farms</strong>. This diligent monitoring enables the precise valuation of each portfolio, which is subsequently compared to the respective debts. Such an approach underscores DeltaPrime’s commitment to financial stability and trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional “push” oracle models, with their limited token set and omission of derivative assets like LP positions, would not provide enough flexibility and security for DeltaPrime. <strong>Many projects resort to calculating on-chain derivative asset pricing, which is susceptible to flash loan manipulations.</strong> Moreover, a traditional on-chain Oracle offers unacceptable refresh intervals of minutes or even hours, depending on the asset. RedStone, however, presents a safer alternative by assessing these positions on a decentralized off-chain layer. This approach ensures fresh data feeds and broad coverage for all assets, farms, and vaults on DeltaPrime, enhancing both security and flexibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Implemented Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The RedStone team proposed the <a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-core\">Core Model</a> to DeltaPrime, which brought a variety of advantages:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It guarantees 10s latency (almost real-time tracking of the value of deposited collateral) which allows users to create more risk-seeking strategies,</li><li>It delivers the price data for ~40 tokens allowing unique combinations of positions and the ability to earn higher yields on less popular and liquid assets,</li><li>It’s affordable to maintain as gas fees are only collected when the data is used to process a transaction on-chain.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qVk1726PhLKbRGhYeuT1a84Ib4Voa2enz7T36cEs7jaIIGTtdZU6gDmuAHUQy6AciG5I8NMOR4_LTeihoaakARl10ZRHSyX3pduoi1Ud1iwpnV20X9_qCM9ru5JwH66QK-qCmTIrkKvCv8wI1qdjSxc\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Implemented solution for DeltaPrime</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone undertook considerable custom development efforts to fulfill DeltaPrime’s needs, offering real-time prices for around 40 assets, <strong>including LP and staked tokens that were previously unprovided by any other Oracle service</strong>. This was made possible through RedStone’s flexible fetchers architecture, which facilitates the swift addition of new price feeds. Collaboratively, both teams conducted risk research to specify a liquidity threshold for asset tracking and devised a methodology to detect price manipulation based on the historical volatility of token prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>The Future of DeltaPrime-RedStone Partnership</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DeltaPrime intends the Prime Account to become the main place for users to manage their blue-chip investments. That means that it needs accurate and reliable pricing on a wide range of assets, which in the future will include RWAs. The fusion of DeltaPrime’s ambition and RedStone’s innovative solutions promises to strengthen DeltaPrime’s position in the market and propel it towards a future where users have unprecedented control and flexibility over their investment decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>DeltaPrime Team Exclusive Interview</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our speaker was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbare00\">Piotr Duda</a>, DeltaPrime Founder &amp; CEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Why have you decided on RedStone?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>RedStone was the only provider that allowed us to get safe data feeds of derivative tokens on the Avalanche C-Chain in the first place.

This allows to broadcast of a large number of assets at high frequency to a cheaper layer and put it on the chain only when required by the protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone Oracles’ entry into the Fuel Ecosystem has introduced unique elements to the DeFi landscape. Primarily, it employs the new Sway language, offering a fresh approach to smart contract programming. Additionally, Fuel’s support for multiple native assets is distinct. Unlike many blockchains focused on a single asset, Fuel allows any asset to be forwarded with a CALL and contracts can maintain balances of all possible assets. However, only the base asset is used for gas fees, balancing innovation with transaction simplicity. These unique features position Fuel distinctively in the blockchain sphere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Fuel x RedStone Integration</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone adopted a modular approach that stores data off-chain until required, thus enhancing efficiency. The @redstone-finance/fuel-connector module is crucial, providing an alternative method of offering oracle data to smart contracts. Data is stored in a decentralized cache layer, managed by RedStone light cache gateways and streamr data broadcasting protocol, until end-users transfer it to the Fuel network. The code structure includes on-chain libraries, various tests, and TypeScript classes for fuel-network layers. The process of connecting to the contract involves importing the connector code and utilizing its methods. Furthermore, RedStone’s fuel-connector is part of the Fuel Grants Program, aimed at supporting projects building on Fuel. This engagement shows RedStone’s commitment to fostering the growth of the Fuel ecosystem. Overall, RedStone’s innovative approach bolsters efficiency in Fuel’s data management.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fuel-ss-1024x512.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-430\" width=\"839\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fuel-ss-1024x512.png 1024w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fuel-ss-300x150.png 300w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fuel-ss-768x384.png 768w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fuel-ss-1536x768.png 1536w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fuel-ss.png 1808w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px\"><figcaption>You can access the app <a href=\"https://fuel-dex.redstone.finance/\">here</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“The integration of RedStone Oracles into the Fuel Ecosystem is a leap forward in our DeFi expansion.

New components are emerging frequently, leading to modifications in syntax and ABI compatibility, necessitating constant vigilance to ensure SDK version alignment with backend configurations. At present, our use of contracts on the latest backend and Sway is impeded by our TypeScript layer. Regardless, we are ready on a component level, eagerly awaiting the possibility of full integration. It’s worth mentioning that despite these challenges, the Fuel team has been exceptionally supportive and instrumental in helping us navigate this complex landscape. Understanding that non-functioning elements are part and parcel of dealing with complex tasks is crucial, as we deviate far from basic operations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recently faced a significant challenge when generating a deep code that the compiler could not accommodate due to its inherent limitations.

RedStone delivers a customizable, secure, and scalable solution that matches Vesta’s requirements. This partnership solidifies Vesta’s role as a prominent stablecoin protocol and sets the stage for growth. In a particular conversation, the Vesta team underscores why RedStone was their choice and how the integration process went.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What’s Vesta Finance?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vesta operates as a layer 2-first stablecoin protocol, enabling users to maximize liquidity against their collateral. Users can secure their collateral and generate Vesta’s stablecoin, VST, which can then be transferred directly to their Ethereum address or any other Ethereum address. These unique collateralized debt positions are referred to as vaults.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stablecoin tokens are economically geared towards maintaining a value of 1 VST = $1 USD, due to the following properties:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The system is designed to always be over-collateralized – the dollar value of the locked Ether exceeds the dollar value of the issued stablecoins.</li><li>The system algorithmically controls the generation of VST through a variable interest fee dictated by the token’s peg.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>After opening a vault with some collateral, users may issue (“borrow”) tokens such that the collateralization ratio of their vault remains above 110%. A user with $1000 worth of underlying collateral in a vault can issue up to 909.09 VST.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vesta system regularly updates the price of the collateral against USD via a decentralized data feed. When a vault falls below a minimum collateralization ratio (MCR) of 110%, it is considered under-collateralized and is vulnerable to liquidation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Vesta’s Oracle Needs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vesta Finance expressed concern about the centralization of their previous oracle solution. As a protocol that prioritizes decentralization, they sought a more decentralized oracle infrastructure. With RedStone’s infrastructure, Vesta Finance can ensure a more secure and reliable oracle system that aligns with their values. This partnership between Vesta Finance and RedStone solidifies their commitment to decentralization and paves the way for a decentralized future in stablecoin protocols.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, Vesta Finance faced limitations in onboarding additional partnerships due to apprehension regarding the centralization of their existing oracle. In response, a strategic decision was made to seek an oracle integration with RedStone. This proactive approach allowed Vesta Finance to address the concerns raised by potential partners and create an environment conducive to fostering collaboration within the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Implemented Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/H6odrtkxvshrtARP13X1hYLUFdFy0TcnOEm9mkVGq-3nmsMgGyV8HrDLpPsXSEZ8LiMBSxURfBsLQa47M1llhSGHtK27letNNz_gj8IOsnN_Ey42SA9TVLCCr1ZIaSLJdRXtaTF8PGHgZJdpxi2rIt4\" alt=\"Image showing technical chart of RedStone Oracles integration with Vesta Finance.\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Redstone team analyzed the liquidity that is available on-chain to identify the best sources that could be used for price discovery.

This milestone demonstrates the seamless fusion of traditional and decentralized finance, reaffirming Voltz’s growing impact in the DeFi sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What is Voltz Protocol?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Voltz is a novel defi primitive, powering leveraged interest rate swaps. The first ever synthetic interest rate swap AMM, Voltz AMM utilizes concentrated liquidity, creating a market that’s c.3000x more capital efficient.

RedStone disrupts the status quo in the oracle space with a modular design, data feeds customizability and presence at all EVM L1 &amp; L2 networks. Angel participation from recognized industry leaders shows conviction that dApps require multiple oracle options to choose from and a single provider is simply not enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>RedStone is Cross-chain by Design, Catering to Builders</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone was founded in 2021 and launched its first production deployments in January 2023. The company <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi/status/1564553885695373312\">raised $7.5 Million</a> in funding from some of the most renowned VCs in the space, including Lemniscap, Blockchain Capital, Maven11 and Coinbase Ventures. RedStone’s modular architecture is going to be a catalyst for the next wave of dApps by providing them with relevant data at low latency. Some of the most titled builders in the Web3 scene participate in this round, including:<br></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Stani Kulechov – Aave Companies Founder and CEO</li><li>Sandeep Nailwal – Polygon Co-Founder</li><li>Alex Gluchovski – Matter Labs (zkSync) CEO &amp; Co-Founder</li><li>Emin Gün Sirer – AvaLabs (Avalanche) CEO &amp; Co-Founder</li><li>Coinflipcanada – GMX Core Contributor</li><li>Jacob Blish – Lido Head of BD and Partnerships</li><li>Richard Ma – Quantstamp CEO</li><li>Marco Cora – Matter Labs (zkSync) SVP Business and Operations</li><li>Patrick Dai – Qtum Founder</li><li>Justin Reyes - Lido Head of DeFi</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“RedStone has created a unique, modular oracle that supports both new and established dApps on L1 and L2 networks. Combined with strong security measures and their ability to deliver non-standard data, RedStone is poised to provide choice and flexibility for the industry,” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>said <strong>Stani Kulechov, Aave Companies Founder and CEO</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Oracle Landscape in 2023 and Beyond</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The oracle market has been stagnant for years, which hinders innovation. Since the publication of Chainlink’s whitepaper in 2017 not much has changed in the way oracles function. At the same time, the Web3 industry went through a few enhancement epochs with the emergence of DeFi, Ethereum upgrades, the LPs and LSTs boom. Currently, Optimistic &amp; ZK roll-ups are thriving and modular architecture has captured wide attention. The latter trend is a crucial dynamic for the future adoption of RedStone’s Oracles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RedStone embraces modular flow and is the same for the oracle space, what L2s are for blockchains – a customizable data scalability layer that inherits the security of the destination chain.</strong><br>By keeping signed data packages in the <a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/how-it-works#data-flow\">RedStone Data Access Layer</a> and delivering them according to conditions set by dApps, gas costs can be reduced by up to 90% while achieving sub-second price feed latency on high-performance ecosystems. RedStone Data Access Layer is flexible, catering to DeFi builders and <a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/\">offers data feeds</a> that are unique and otherwise unavailable in the industry. Moreover, RedStone does not waste gas to push the same data to multiple chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone’s unique position is an implication of the strain an oracle encounters, when moving from a monolithic to a modular architecture. Barriers include technical debt, agreements with clients and data providers, or security risks of changing the legacy design. RedStone was designed with built-in modularity, allowing for quick response to market trends. The team had to overcome numerous technical challenges and gas optimisation problems to enable secure and the most performant data consumption models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protocols and builders start to realise that Redstone offers secure and innovative alternative for the existing oracles. RedStone has been promoting the On-Demand approach for the past 2 years and is ready to be used on over 40 different L1s and L2s, having a head start over competitors in that space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To create innovative protocols, we can’t keep on using the same concepts from the 2020 DeFi summer. The way oracles work has not evolved much in the past years, which stifles growth. We need quick responses to market trends, an architecture compatible with zk-powered L2s and optimization in gas costs – that’s what RedStone Oracles brings to the table,” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>said <strong>Sandeep Nailwal, Polygon Co-Founder</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Differentiates RedStone From Competitors?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone’s Modular architecture allows for <a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/\">offering data feeds</a> not available with any of its competitors and enables tailored data consumption models. Customizability has been an unanswered need from other oracle providers, yet it’s the cornerstone for novel implementations. Builders need more freedom in parameters such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Data aggregation mechanisms (for both off- and on-chain aggregation),</li><li>Heartbeat and deviation threshold adjusted for specific dApp,</li><li>Flow of data on-chain injection (pull vs push vs new ones),</li><li>Custom flows of liquidation/opening a position.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, a major differentiation is that with RedStone the protocol has full clarity and transparency in terms of data sources and origins of consumed price feeds – as opposed to the black box offered by other major players on the market. Finally, all delivered <a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/how-it-works#data-unpacking-on-chain-data-verification\">data is verified on-chain</a>, therefore the integrity of price feeds is as secure as the consensus model of the target chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Along the way we had to solve countless tech challenges such as Assembly-level optimisation of costs, so we are confident that our implementation is the most technologically advanced on-demand oracle model. Moreover, we give dApps creators a spectrum of customisation options regarding off-chain and on-chain aggregation methods, as well as an option to pick Data Providers they trust.”, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>said <strong>Jakub Wojciechowski, RedStone CEO &amp; Founder.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-9-1024x382.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-404\" srcset=\"https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-9-1024x382.png 1024w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-9-300x112.png 300w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-9-768x287.png 768w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-9-1536x573.png 1536w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-9.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>RedStone is </em><a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/supported-chains\"><em>ready to use</em></a><em> on 40+ L1s &amp; L2s, above major supported ecosystems.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>The end of “One Oracle Model Fits It All”</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone’s mission is to allow builders to create exactly what they have envisioned.

This enables over- and undercollateralized lending protocols such as DeltaPrime to bring their liquidity to Pangolin building a capital-efficient ecosystem with lower slippage in-between trades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeltaPrime needs real-time price data allowing the protocol to provide secure undercollateralized loans for its users. The precision of the data is of utmost importance here. Without it, the collateral price would not be represented accurately, which could put&nbsp; Pangolin’s TVL and DeltaPrime’s liquidity providers’ money at risk. To avoid bad debt creation, based on RedStone’s pricing data, Delta Prime calculates Health Score – a parameter which tells the protocol when to liquidate its user’s positions and give the tokens back to its LPs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Borrowed funds must be repaid in the same asset they were issued with. When liquidation occurs, the bot will pay back the loan in the following steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Calculate how much should be repaid to bring the loan back to a safe level.</li><li>Repay part of the loan from tokens supplied by the liquidation bot.</li><li>Transfer part of account positions + liquidation bonus to the liquidator.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>That means: The tighter the margin, the bigger the profits for LPs meaning the more accurate price, the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>About Pangolin</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pangolin is a multichain decentralized digital assets exchange (DEX).

RedStone offers a scalable, customizable, and decentralized solution that aligns perfectly with Mento’s needs. This collaboration strengthens Mento’s position as a leading stablecoin provider and paves the way for expansion. In an exclusive interview, the Mento Labs team reveals why RedStone was a clear choice and highlights the seamless integration process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Mento: Factory for Stable Value Assets</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mento is a decentralized exchange of the automated market maker (AMM) type that operates exclusively on the Celo blockchain. Its primary function is to support the peg of the Celo Dollar (cUSD) to the US Dollar. The protocol enables the creation of stable value digital products, that mimic the value of the underlying asset, i.e. fiat currencies (commonly referred to as ‘stablecoins’). The goal of Mento is to support the real-world adoption of digital currencies by enabling the creation of stable value assets for users around the world. Mento is currently live on the Celo blockchain where it operates the Celo Dollar (cUSD), Celo Euro (cEUR), and the Celo Brazilian Real (cReal). All Mento products are <a href=\"https://reserve.mento.org/\">fully collateralized</a> with a diversified portfolio of exogenous crypto assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Mento’s Oracle Needs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mento is a permissionless and decentralized platform that aims to host a large variety of stable value assets of different designs. Such a platform requires a highly scalable, customizable and decentralized oracle solution. The Mento team was looking at many oracle providers but they hadn’t found what they were looking for so they decided to develop their own oracle. Over time it turned out that the in-house solution is hard to maintain and additional safety layers would come at a disproportional cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Implemented Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mentoredstone-1024x493.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-344\" width=\"689\" height=\"331\" srcset=\"https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mentoredstone-1024x493.png 1024w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mentoredstone-300x144.png 300w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mentoredstone-768x370.png 768w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mentoredstone-1536x740.png 1536w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mentoredstone-2048x986.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px\"><figcaption>Overview chart showing one part of the implemented solution</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mento team came across RedStone Oracles, soon after the first successful launch of their data feeds for DeltaPrime. Flexibility and the highest security standards were key factors for Mento’s oracle decision. RedStone provided Mento with a rigid data quality assurance process, introducing an uncertainty score that will be calculated at the data provider nodes based on:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Scoring system per data source that will take into account a deviation between bid &lt;&gt; ask spread on CEX sources and available liquidity on DEX sources,</li><li>Cross-source aggregation to weight sources based on the score mentioned above,</li><li>Additional checks against maximum historical deviations to detect price manipulation attempts.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of which are sophisticated mechanisms giving additional layers of security to the flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The uncertainty score mechanism consists of 3 layers:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Source-specific</strong> reliability layer (e.g. bid/ask spread, order book depth to make sure data sources provide reliable data).</li><li><strong>Certainty layer</strong> (e.g. price difference across price sources to make sure that market certainty/efficiency is sufficiently high).</li><li><strong>Consensus layer</strong> to make sure all operators agree on reliability, uncertainty and data.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The data feeds will be further aggregated on-chain allowing Mento not only to use the spot prices but also to take account of the accompanying uncertainty scores in a transparent way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>The Future of Mento-RedStone Partnership</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, both parties plan to expand their implementation to other Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) blockchain solutions, broadening the reach of Mento’s capabilities. Additionally, Mento and RedStone are committed to collaborating with new protocols that aim to launch their stablecoins using Mento’s innovative technology. This approach will not only solidify Mento’s position as a leading stablecoin provider but also ensure that emerging projects benefit from the proven stability and reliability of Mento’s cutting-edge solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Mento Labs Team Exclusive Interview</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our speaker is Nadiem Sissouno.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Why did you decide on RedStone Oracles?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-4 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-3 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Many oracle solutions out there are:</p><p>– Rather centralized and permissioned,<br>-They do not scale well and,<br>-They are not customizable to the specific needs of a particular application</p><p>RedStone on the other hand, checked all of the requirement boxes for us.

It auto-compounds rewards to save users time and gas fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Each farm is a pool of deposits from Yield Yak users</li><li>Farms earn reward tokens (like $AVAX)</li><li>Farms reinvest all rewards, compounding everyone’s deposits</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All depositors benefit from the high frequency of Yield Yak compounding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What if I want to get even more leverage?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is composable leverage. A composable leverage protocol amplifies market exposure by leveraging assets and integrating with other protocols for tailored strategies. It involves borrowing against existing assets to magnify gains potentially but also increases the risk of losses. These protocols offer flexibility with risk management utilizing smart contracts and automated algorithms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protocols doing that are e.g. <a href=\"https://deltaprime.io/\">DeltaPrime</a> or <a href=\"https://gearbox.fi/\">Gearbox</a>. As Avalanche native protocol, DeltaPrime allows you to enter YieldYak’s pools and strategies on leverage. While these investors risk liquidation if they make bad investments, they can also reap more significant rewards by making sound investments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>YieldYak’s strategies &amp; pools one can tap into:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>AVAX strategy on AAVE</li><li>sAVAX strategy on Platypus</li><li>GLP strategy on GMX</li><li>AVAX-USDC on Pangolin</li><li>AVAX-ETH from Pangolin</li><li>AVAX-USDC from TraderJoe</li><li>AVAX-ETH from TraderJoe</li><li>AVAX-sAVAX from TraderJoe</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"458\" src=\"https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-2-1024x458.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-336\" srcset=\"https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-2-1024x458.png 1024w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-2-300x134.png 300w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-2-768x344.png 768w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-2-1536x687.png 1536w, https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-2.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>YieldYak’s strategies &amp; pools on DeltaPrime</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Redstone securely provides a real-time valuation for tokens from the above 8 pools, allowing other protocols to deploy and monitor liquidity automatically. The more protocols integrate price feeds for Yield Yak derivatives; the more liquidity is deployed into Yield Yak pools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What role do RedStone Oracles play here?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeltaPrime needs a specific real-time data price to allow users to use leverage. Without it, the collateral price could drop, and DeltaPrime’s liquidity providers would lose money. The protocol has a level at which it liquidates the position and gives back tokens to its LPs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Borrowed funds must be repaid in the same currency they were issued with. When liquidation occurs, the bot will pay back the loan in the following steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Calculate how much should be repaid to bring the loan back to a safe level.</li><li>Repay part of the loan from tokens supplied by the liquidation bot.</li><li>Transfer part of account positions + liquidation bonus to the liquidator.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>That means: The tighter the margin, the bigger the profits for LPs meaning the more accurate price, the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default\">\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>About Yield Yak</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yield Yak builds tools for DeFi users on Avalanche.

Playing a significant role in enhancing communication and data sharing among all Avalanche Subnets. As a result, the Avalanche ecosystem witnessed a surge in growth and collaboration, further solidifying its position as a leading platform for decentralized applications and services.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>HyperSDK</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2023, Avalanche introduced <a href=\"https://medium.com/avalancheavax/introducing-hypersdk-a-foundation-for-the-fastest-blockchains-of-the-future-a6b1609a6862\">HyperSDK</a>. This developer toolkit has enabled developers to simplify and accelerate custom Virtual Machine development. HyperSDK has attracted numerous innovative projects and developers to the Avalanche platform, contributing to its overall growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Subnets Launch (Elastic, Evergreen, Spurce)</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Avalanche ecosystem is becoming more accessible for institutions by launching <a href=\"https://medium.com/avalancheavax/banff-elastic-subnets-44042f41e34c\">Elastic</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/avalancheavax/avalanche-launches-evergreen-subnets-for-institutional-blockchain-deployments-8cb75cfcc151\">Evergreen</a> and Spruce Subnets. These subnets have introduced a new level of customization and scalability to the platform making the chain use-case-specific. RedStone is a proud Spruce launch partner, delivering data feeds in both Core and Classic Oracle models to the newly launched subnet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi\">RedStone</a> achieved numerous key milestones too.

What is more we’re launching on Polygon zkEVM from day 1 of mainnet beta together with our newest partner QiDAO!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What is Polygon zkEVM?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polygon zkEVM is a decentralized Ethereum Layer 2 scalability solution that uses cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to offer validity and quick finality to off-chain transaction computation, also known as a ZK-Rollup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the first zero-knowledge scaling solution that is fully equivalent to an EVM. All existing smart contracts, developer toolings and wallets work seamlessly. The zkEVM harnesses the power of ZK proofs to reduce transaction cost and massively increase throughput, all while inheriting the security of Ethereum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Advantages of Polygon zkEVM</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ethereum-equivalence</li><li>Ethereum security</li><li>ZKP-powered scalability</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Polygon zkEVM is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that leverages the scaling power of zero-knowledge proofs while maintaining Ethereum compatibility. Developers and users on Polygon zkEVM can use the same code, tooling, apps, etc that they use on Ethereum, but with much higher throughput and lower fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers will deploy their existing contracts to the zkEVM, and users can deposit assets from Ethereum and transact off-chain. These transactions are grouped into batches with zero-knowledge proof attesting to the validity of each transaction. This ensures that the operators of the zkEVM can’t steal user funds, so we can say that it inherits the security of Ethereum. Polygon zkEVM offers compatibility and scalability without compromise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What is QiDAO?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>QiDao is an overcollateralized stablecoin protocol that allows users to mint stablecoins (MAI) against the value of their decentralized token collaterals. Minting occurs through loans, denominated in MAI stablecoins. All loans have 0% interest, meaning the value of the related debt does not change over time. A 0.5% repayment fee is charged when debt positions are repaid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MAI is a USD stablecoin backed solely by decentralized tokens. Its target peg is 1% within the US Dollar. MAI can only be minted by users through overcollateralized debt positions. MAI is a decentralized stablecoin and cannot be manipulated by centralized entities. QiDao is a community-run, community-governed protocol. Changes are made through proposals and voted on by holders of the governance token, Qi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manhattan.finance is a frontend connected to QiDao that enables fixed-rate lending for any asset. Tokens are made available through isolated lending markets. These markets are created in partnership with protocols that manage tokens. As a result, every loan has 1 lender and 1 borrower. Lender protocols can deposit and withdraw their tokens at will, provided the tokens are currently not being lent out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Cooperation with RedStone</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the upcoming launch of Polygon zkEVM on mainnet BETA on March 27th, its expanding dApp ecosystem requires reliable Data Feeds. RedStone is set to provide Polygon zkEVM with Data Feeds for over 1100 assets right from day one of the launch, including cryptocurrency prices, stocks, commodities, NFTs, on-chain reputation, and much more. Developers can also take advantage of our <a href=\"https://custom.redstone.finance/\">Custom URL feature</a> to instantly utilize any API data in their dApps. Manhattan.finance protocol, which allows fixed-rate lending for all kinds of assets, will use RedStone oracles to acquire price data necessary for loan facilitation and calculation of liquidation thresholds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Polygon channels:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/\">https://polygon.technology/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xPolygon\">https://twitter.com/0xPolygon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/0xPolygon\">https://discord.com/invite/0xPolygon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/\">https://github.com/maticnetwork/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>QiDAO channels:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.mai.finance/\">https://www.mai.finance/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/QiDaoProtocol\">https://twitter.com/QiDaoProtocol</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/mQq55j65xJ\">https://discord.com/invite/mQq55j65xJ</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manhattan Finance Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Manhattan_fi\">https://twitter.com/Manhattan_fi</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manhattan Finance website: <a href=\"https://app.manhattan.finance/\">https://app.manhattan.finance/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RedStone channels:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://redstone.finance/\">https://redstone.finance/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi\">https://twitter.com/redstone_defi</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46\">https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance\">https://github.com/redstone-finance</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/</a></p>\n","id":29,"urlQuery":"redstonepowered-ep-polygon-zkevm"},{"class_article":"post-299 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-uncategorized layout-grid  ","link":"https://blog.redstone.finance/2023/03/15/float-x-gelato-x-redstone-the-fastest-price-data-for-the-best-user-experience/","title":"Float x Gelato x RedStone = the fastest price data for the best user experience","description":"The synergy of RedStone’s on-demand Oracles and Gelato’s Web3 functions is a game changer for DeFi.

Float integrated these solutions, allowing them to process user transactions <strong>20x faster</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What is Float?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Float creates peer-to-peer markets where you can mint leveraged tokens in a single click. Leveraged tokens allow you to gain exposure to leveraged returns of popular crypto assets without the additional risks of liquidations, margin maintenance, and collateralized debt positions. Float Arctic is the latest version of the Float protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Float Arctic uses a multi-pool architecture to ensure that your leveraged tokens will receive fixed leverage. That means a token minted at 3x leverage will always get 3x leverage. It won’t float within a range, nor will it ever need to rebalance. Instead, your leverage is supported by a liquidity tranche called the Float pool, which balances all positions in exchange for a funding rate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Float is the easiest and most enjoyable place to trade leverage. Once contracts are approved, you can mint tokens, burn your tokens and mint any other tokens, and redeem your tokens for collateral in one click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What is Gelato?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gelato.network/\">Gelato</a> is web3’s decentralized backend empowering builders to create augmented smart contracts that are automated, gasless &amp; off-chain aware. Leading web3 projects rely on Gelato to power the execution of millions of transactions across DeFi, NFT, and Gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Cooperation with RedStone and Gelato</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to offer seamless leverage exposure to users, Float retrieves prices for the relevant markets using oracles. In the newest iteration, they combine RedStone on-demand oracles with Gelato’s Web3 functions making the transactions <strong>20x faster!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How is it possible?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Float’s system uses the “RedStone Cache Layer,” an off-chain, decentralized network of nodes that collect validated price data. This updated and verified data is then used by the newest product from Gelato – <a href=\"https://www.gelato.network/blog/web3-functions-serverless-apps#how-web-functions-work\">Web3 Functions</a>, to update Float’s system state. As a result, incoming user transactions are executed and pool balances are updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Questions to the Float team</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q1. What are the beginnings of Float?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all started with a dream. The three founders met while doing postgraduate studies at the University of Cape Town. After winning an Ethereum hackathon they hit the international ETH conference scene, won more hackathons, and became really successful consulting with DeFi startups and auditing contracts. Eventually, one partner was so impressed that he gave the founders an ultimatum: either work for him or, if they had an idea, let him invest in them. The team had been exploring the synthetic asset protocol Synthetix and wanted to build something that was simpler and more capital efficient for users. From that, the idea for Float was born, and the founders raised an initial pre-seed round of $1 million. The team scaled. In September 2021 our v1 – Float Alpha – went live. In early 2022 we closed a seed round of $5 million from amazing VCs like Maven 11, IDEO CoLab Ventures, and MetaCartel Ventures, and angel investors like Stani Kulechov. Since then we’ve been working flat out towards our v2 – Float Arctic.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q2. What is an interesting fact about Float?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are tons. We’re a small team – only 10. Most of us are from South Africa. We’re all really close friends. We meet up in person twice a year. We try and meet by the sea. We do morning cold swims – everyone runs into the freezing ocean screaming “we’re in the prime of our lives”. We’re a young team. The oldest member of the team is our CMO Campbell, and he’s only 30. We put tech first. Security is our number one priority, followed by high engineering standards. While Float Arctic was in evolution and we hadn’t settled on a final design for the mechanism, we took the decision to effectively rewrite all the Alpha code line by line. We made Float Arctic modular, such that when we decided to add in the Float pool mechanism, we were able to largely ship it in two weeks. This extends to being able to switch from push-based to pull-based oracles on a dime and integrate a great product like RedStone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q3. Where do you see Float 3 years from now?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our mission is to build innovative financial primitives and DeFi infrastructure. We’re committed to our investors and users to build something special. We’re going to take Float as far as we can and build a product that can dominate DeFi, and be as significant and reliable as AAVE and MakerDAO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Float channels:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://float.capital/\">https://float.capital/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/float_shipping\">https://twitter.com/float_shipping</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/float-capital\">https://discord.com/invite/float-capital</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/float-capital\">https://github.com/float-capital</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gelato channels:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.gelato.network/\">https://www.gelato.network/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gelatonetwork\">https://twitter.com/gelatonetwork</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/gelatonetwork\">https://discord.gg/gelatonetwork</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/gelatodigital\">https://github.com/gelatodigital</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/gelato-digital/\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/gelato-digital/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RedStone channels:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://redstone.finance/\">https://redstone.finance/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi\">https://twitter.com/redstone_defi</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46\">https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance\">https://github.com/redstone-finance</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/</a></p>\n","id":28,"urlQuery":"float-x-gelato-x-redstone--the-fastest-price-data-for-the-best-user-experience"},{"class_article":"post-278 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-uncategorized layout-grid  ","link":"https://blog.redstone.finance/2023/03/01/redstonepowered-ep-11-canto/","title":"#RedStonePowered ep.11: Canto","description":"We are excited to announce that Canto is now #RedStonePowered! ♦️ If you want to build a data-powered dApp on this EVM-compatible, permissionless, layer-1 blockchain… Read More »\n#RedStonePowered ep.11: Canto","autor":"by RedStone","date":"March 1, 2023","image":"https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Frame-38.jpg","content":"\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are excited to announce that Canto is now <strong>#RedStonePowered!</strong> ♦️<img draggable=\"false\" role=\"img\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\"⚡\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/26a1.svg\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to build a data-powered dApp on this EVM-compatible, permissionless, layer-1 blockchain built to deliver on the promise of DeFi, look no further.

It was built to deliver on the promise of DeFi – that through a post-traditional financial movement, new systems will be made accessible, transparent, decentralized, and free. Canto is built using Tendermint Consensus with an EVM execution layer via Cosmos SDK. It is a fully decentralized chain from the beginning – had no presale, no foundation and no VCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Core Tenets of Canto</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Liquidity as a Free Public Good – Zero fees for Liquidity Providers (LPs). Canto makes liquidity free for protocols, arbitrageurs and traders.</li><li>Rent Extraction Resistant – Canto aims to establish Free Public Infrastructure. Core DeFi primitives will not have sovereign governance tokens, nor the capacity to extract rent in the future.&nbsp;</li><li>Minimal Viable User Capture – Where possible, Canto avoids interface-driven user ownership. Public infrastructure DEXes will have no swapping interface, so all users must trade on third-party aggregators.

We now provide the necessary data for all your applications’ oracle needs!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What is Mantle?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mantle is a high-performance Ethereum layer-2 network built with modular architecture delivering high security with low fees. Builders can leverage Mantle’s innovative yet intuitive design to build dApps with exceptional UX, all while guaranteed by Ethereum-grade security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, Mantle has been built with a modular architecture that uses an optimistic rollup with an innovative data availability solution. This allows Mantle to inherit security from Ethereum AND offer cheaper and more accessible data availability. The Mantle network is the first Ethereum layer-2 chain initiated by a DAO. BitDAO is seeding an ecosystem of projects for the Mantle network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Advantages of Mantle</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Modular Data Availability: Through the use of<a href=\"https://www.eigenlayer.com/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.eigenlayer.com/\">EigenLayer</a>, Mantle is able to increase transaction throughput beyond incumbent&nbsp; L2s. Accessible data availability also means Mantle can increase throughput without compromising on security, reducing the overhead of node operations. This decreases the processing requirement for validators and increases decentralization.</li><li>Multi-Party Computation (MPC): Mantle uses MPC to minimize the trust risk of L2 execution results. Using <a href=\"https://docs.mantle.xyz/for-validators/multi-party-computation\">Threshold Signature Scheme</a> (TSS) technology, specialized nodes contribute to multi-party signatures that improve the correctness of off-chain transaction execution results. This allows Mantle to shorten the challenge period for withdrawals.</li><li>Decentralized Sequencer: Mantle will decentralize its sequencer to offer secure and trustless block production. By rotating through a permissionless sequencer set, Mantle will reduce the potential for a single point of failure or censorship on the network. Mantle will, over time, permissionlessly decentralize its sequencer to offer secure and trustless block production.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Cooperation with RedStone</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a new, fast growing ecosystem, Mantle builders are in need of reliable Data Feeds.&nbsp;RedStone now provides Mantle Network with Data Feeds for 1100+ assets: prices of cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, NFTs, on-chain reputation, and much more.

What are the beginnings of Mantle?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mantle was started from <a href=\"https://discourse.bitdao.io/t/archived-bit-network-an-iterative-modular-chain-approach/2988\">this</a> BitNetwork proposal. The BitDAO collective has been a trailblazer in blockchain innovations and web3 capacity building since its inception. Mantle epitomizes BitDAO’s ambition to champion web3 ecosystems of people, products, services, and public goods.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q2. What is an interesting fact about Mantle?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mantle is a high-performance Ethereum L2 network built by BitDAO and governed by the $BIT community. Since its inception in July 2021, BitDAO has become one of the largest decentralized treasuries in the world with billions in assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q3. What excites you the most about what you’re building?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are building the world’s first iterative modular L2 chain to scale Ethereum, initiated by a DAO. BitDAO subscribes to the values above, and Ethereum’s ethos and vision are most aligned with what BitDAO is building in its vision of a web3 future. Moreover, Ethereum is also the most widely adopted tech stack, with countless projects thriving in its ecosystem. By adopting this stack, we can leverage a wide network of developers and developer resources to accelerate web3 adoption.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q4.

If you are building a data-powered dApp, or Metaverse project look no further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What is Caduceus?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caduceus is the world’s first blockchain dedicated to Metaverse development. In other words, it is a distributed ledger based platform with unique technology that makes deploying and running Metaverse applications much more efficient as compared to conventional blockchains. Caduceus uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture to store transactions and achieve consensus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Advantages of Caduceus</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Scalability – fast, low-cost and secure transactions.</li><li>Metaverse support – intrinsic support for 3D objects and vectors</li><li>Security – fund security, NFT asset security, users’ privacy security, trusted transactions, automatic settlement, and DAO user autonomy through a scalable blockchain network.</li><li>Cloud Computing – Caduceus provides decentralised cloud computing support for the metaverse through a massive distributed network encompassing IPFS storage/GPU cloud rendering/SWAN</li><li>Hardware innovations – Caduceus provides the metaverse with a blossoming device ecology through the advanced XR Glass open-source hardware solution, lowering the hardware threshold and increasing device penetration.</li><li>Edge Rendering – provide 3D designers, game developers, game users and Metaverse users with a powerful distributed rendering computing power – edge rendering system;</li><li>Tooling – provide Metaverse UGC development tools, creation tools, game editing tools and user-defined editing tools for creative developers and users;</li><li>Infrastructure – materials NFT market, scene NFT market and game props NFT market</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Cooperation with RedStone</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As every fast growing ecosystem Caduceus builders are in need of reliable Data Feeds. We now support the growth of this chain by providing data for 1100+ assets covering cryptocurrencies, NFTs, randomness, equities, commodities, on-chain reputation, and much more. We are certain that dApps and games on Caduceus can leverage our cost-effective oracles for a number of use cases, so builders – feel free to reach out to us!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Questions to Caduceus Team</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q1. How did you get into the web3 space?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A long-standing market need exists for Web3 and the metaverse, and as corporate capital pours into the metaverse, the demand for support services has increased. Building a large-scale metaverse platform is a good concept for particular purposes and subjects – sports, arts, and consumer brands have been the most popular, and it was obvious that merging them needed a new economic model and gameplay innovation. A few years ago, I met many like-minded partners; we created a team and used our imaginations to attempt to build Caduceus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q2. What is the origin of the Caduceus?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>People devote less attention to computing and rendering, despite their importance to the metaverse. Whether it be sports, art, or consumer goods, the metaverse requires a great deal of processing power and accurate graphics rendering technologies to actualize it. Caduceus must become a crucial component in the creation of the Metaverse. We hope that metaverse developers will be able to use a lower trial and error cost and a purer environment to conduct a large number of experiments on Caduceus in order to validate some hypotheses. In the Caduceus metaverse ecology, creators will also have access to a greater variety of communication, motivation, and identification options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q3. What excites you the most about what you’re building?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, the thought of Caduceus’ open metaverse intrigues me the most. Caduceus and Bin Zayed Group are collaborating strategically to construct a digital metropolis in Dubai. Simultaneously, Light Cycle, which was incubated on the chain, has lately constructed a virtual village that may be used by future artists. Completely open with the brand side, allowing creators to freely create. We will also see AI virtual image expression and a new wave of interesting Web3 innovations such as games based on a stable economic model.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q4.

Introducing KYD Oracle.","autor":"by RedStone","date":"December 5, 2022","image":"https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Znaki-z-napisami-8-2.jpg","content":"\n<p><em>TLDR: KYD Oracle means Institutional adoption meets <img draggable=\"false\" role=\"img\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\"🤝\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f91d.svg\"> DeFi Principles. It’s a ‘firewall’ for DeFi protocols making sure they only allow Users they are legally eligible to interact with. Powered by on-chain data with no need for access to sensitive information and no additional third-party risks. Invisible for the End User&nbsp; – the interaction with a ‘protected’ protocol looks identical as with a regular, ‘unprotected’ protocol.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>2022 has already demonstrated clearly that Forced Regulations for Web3 are coming. DeFi Protocols face an existential threat if they fail to implement the necessary legal procedures such as KYC or AML. There is a major concern that regulated DeFi would inherit the same issues TradFi struggles with. Centralized Exchanges have already gone the ‘hard regulation’ path and this might be the future for DEXs and other decentralized protocols as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Does KYC/AML undermine the purpose of Decentralised Finance?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many benefits behind a situation where the protocol you interact with does not know anything particularly sensitive about you as the user. We have heard numerous stories of people’s bank accounts being attacked after the data breach associated with the recent FTX meltdown. CEXs already cannot operate without implementing strict legal measures and collecting substantial amounts of sensitive user data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeFi’s accessibility, deeply embedded in its ethos, is largely based on the fact that KYC is not required there. It allows people from underprivileged backgrounds to participate in the global ecosystem under the same conditions as everybody else with an internet connection being the only barrier to entry. It also preserves digital freedom for everybody who is deeply concerned about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, we are gradually approaching the institutional adoption of blockchains. Major Investment Banks already have 500+ people teams working solely on Web3-related products. JP Morgan recently announced making its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCXtl-nLIos&amp;ab_channel=TheDefiant-DeFi%2CWeb3%26NFTInsights\">first DeFi trade</a>. However, institutional clients need regulatory stability with KYC/AML being an essential part of it. This is the main source of friction that needs to be alleviated before we see some serious moves from the big players.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional KYC implemented on DEXs probably would not undermine their existence but surely would reduce their utility in many areas. Also, you wouldn’t want to give your ID to every single DEX you have ever interacted with would you? However, there might be a way around it. In essence, regulated DeFi protocols would have to accept only those Users, who meet certain legal conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s assume that the data needed for such validation might already be on-chain. There should be a way to perform the User check without the need to collect more data or introduce new third-party risks. This would mean that the protocols can make sure they are fully compliant with the regulations and the user can leverage their on-chain activity and KYC processes they have already completed to get access to ‘regulated’ DeFi.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We might have just the right solution for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><br><strong>Introducing KYD Oracle</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we present a new approach: a robust proof of the User’s legitimacy, invisible for the End User of a dApp and needing no access to the End User’s personal data. This opens DeFi up for institutions while maintaining seamless User Experience and introducing no counterparty risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>KYD stands for Know Your Data (also, potentially, Know Your Defi-user). The Oracle checks a given wallet against a set of conditions specified by the Smart Contract creator.&nbsp;Everything you do on-chain is an immutable piece of your <em>reputation</em>. KYD Oracle leverages that along with the KYC/AML processes you have already gone through to give you a ‘score’ within the DeFi space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an <strong>automatic way of checking your legal eligibility</strong> when you interact with the DeFi smart contract. No additional steps on your end are needed, no popups, no logging into an external service. It all happens through the code and is powered by on-chain data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Example Use Case</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s assume a major Investment Bank wants to open a new Decentralised Exchange for Tokenised Real-Word Assets. Because of legal reasons, the newly created DEX can only be accessed by Users meeting a predefined set of conditions, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The User received a transfer from Coinbase within the past 6 months,</li><li>The User received a single transfer of at least $100,&nbsp;</li><li>The User has never interacted with a mixer.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For the End Users, the flow of interaction looks as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The User clicks <em>Connect Wallet</em> and signs the message,&nbsp;</li><li>Underneath, our Oracle checks the User’s address against a predefined set of conditions.<br></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The check happens instantly within a single transaction. If the User’s address is eligible the transaction gets through seamlessly – the interaction works the same way as with any other DEX. If the End User’s address is not eligible, the transaction gets reverted with a message explaining the cause.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to remember that AML/KYC is the art of dealing with risk and mitigating it by raising standards and implementing best practices. KYD Oracle does not eliminate the risk of interacting with a malicious actor completely. You can think of it the way you would think about Risk Scoring – we don’t eradicate the risk but we make sure that it is minimized to a level acceptable by institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The right AML/KYC implementation is also heavily dependent on a variety of factors such as the specific case of a given institution, jurisdiction, accepted business risk, and many others. Institutions must also be ready for dynamic changes in this field, especially in the blockchain context where rules are still being shaped. Offering an off-the-shelf AML/KYC product with strictly predefined functionalities would not make much sense at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, our goal is to develop technology allowing institutions to define their own rules and adjust them flexibly to their own use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Technical details</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone takes care of indexing the chain to build an instantly accessible database for verifying conditions. For POC purposes, we have built an Indexer gathering all the addresses that have ever received a transfer from Coinbase. Currently, we are adding more data sources to cover a broader spectrum of conditions and meet the needs of interested parties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system uses an on-demand model where the Oracle Node provides the score of a requested wallet address. Everything happens instantly and within a single transaction triggered by the End User interacting with the Smart Contract. No additional steps are required thanks to our EVM-connector technology pushing the data on the chain via meta transaction pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is just the first implementation we have created for POC purposes. However, we can easily go way beyond that by leveraging our 2nd product – <a href=\"https://warp.cc/\">Warp Contracts</a>. This will allow for the implementation of significantly more complicated data rules, including large sets of conditions, and performing complex computations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Want to try it out?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go to the KYD Oracle <a href=\"https://coinbase-kyd-showroom.redstone.finance\" title=\"Demo Page\">Demo Page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To dive deeper into the tech be sure to check out <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance/coinbase-kyd-showroom\" title=\"KYD Oracle Repository\">KYD Oracle Repository</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Path Forward</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flexibility of our Oracle design allows us to provide deeply customized solutions for institutional use cases. This is the first time we are showing this solution to the public. However, we have already had many talks with parties interested in integrating it, and right now we are adjusting the product to their specific needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next steps? Including some more sophisticated logic and combining on-chain + off-chain data. Instead of asking: <em>Has this wallet ever received a transfer from Coinbase?</em> the institutional client might be asking for an attestation that the End User is above the legal age in their country of residence. As you might have guessed, we are also experimenting heavily with ZK Proofs in this field as well. Expect more information on that after we finish testing the hypotheses with interested parties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At RedStone we are on a mission to build the next generation of Oracles. Our solution has an unrivaled ability to exert significant control over any new data listings. Result? The flexibility to follow any emerging market trends, alongside substantial cost savings, allows us to stay at the frontier of a new wave of Decentralised Finance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join us on the journey!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi\">Twitter</a> |<a href=\"http://redstone.finance/discord\"> Discord</a> |<a href=\"https://redstone.finance/\"> Website</a> |<a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance\"> Github</a> |<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/\"> Linkedin</a></p>\n","id":22,"urlQuery":"can-institutional-players-interact-safely-with-defi-yes-they-can-introducing-kyd-oracle"},{"class_article":"post-234 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-uncategorized layout-grid  ","link":"https://blog.redstone.finance/2022/12/02/redstonepowered-ep-6-fantom/","title":"#RedStonePowered ep.6: Fantom","description":"We are excited to announce that Fantom is now #RedStonePowered! ♦️ If you want to build a data-powered dApp on this EVM-compatible, fast and secure… Read More »\n#RedStonePowered ep.6: Fantom","autor":"by RedStone","date":"December 2, 2022","image":"https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fantom.png","content":"\n<p>We are excited to announce that Fantom is now <strong>#RedStonePowered!</strong> ♦️<img draggable=\"false\" role=\"img\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\"⚡\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/26a1.svg\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to build a data-powered dApp on this EVM-compatible, fast and secure chain, look no further.

Created in 2015 by folks who have been in the blockchain space since its inception (more on that in the Questions section below), Rootstock can surely be called one of the OG blockchains. Since its Mainnet launch on January 2018 Rootstock has already proven its reliability by staying relentless through numerous market cycles we have seen over the past couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a technical standpoint, Rootstock is a Bitcoin sidechain. RBTC, or ‘smart Bitcoin’,&nbsp; is the native token of Rootstock, used to pay for transactions on the network, pegged 1:1 to BTC through <a href=\"https://developers.rsk.co/rsk/architecture/powpeg/\">the Powpeg</a>. The Powpeg is secured by Bitcoin proof of work,&nbsp; leveraging the value of bitcoin as the most valuable cryptocurrency globally and broadening its applicability to all conceivable dApp use cases. Over the years the Rootstock network has also introduced a lot of usability improvements for Bitcoin including faster transactions and better scalability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Cooperation with RedStone</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone now provides Rootstock’s Builders with Data Feeds for +1100 assets: prices of cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, on-chain reputation, and much more. Builders can also use our <a href=\"https://custom.redstone.finance/\">Custom URL feature</a> to plug in any API and use the data in their Rootstock Smart Contacts instantly. We are well-positioned to be the cornerstone of a new wave of data-powered applications, leveraging the security and robustness of Bitcoin through Rootstock’s infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Questions to </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SDLerner\"><strong>Sergio Lerner</strong></a><strong> – Rootstock Co-Founder</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q1. How did you get into the web3 space?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t “get” into the web3 space. It was more like the web3 space was created around me, with me already inside of it. Back in 2008 I researched and worked to build a peer-to-peer fair gaming platform. This platform enabled users to freely and securely play p2p poker. This is the kind of project that can only flourish together with a strong and global web3 infrastructure because it requires many decentralized components: domain resolution, communications, hosting, and payments. In 2011 I was actively researching decentralized currencies to enable betting and gambling without intermediaries. This led me to create the proof of concept of the first Turing complete smart contracts platform back in 2013, and the first usable implementation of state channels in 2014. The cypherpunk ideals of anonymous identities, private digital cash, and decentralized websites were something I was expecting to happen. Some things materialized quickly (like Bitcoin) while others are still a distant dream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q2. What are the beginnings of Rootstock?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015 I was working on the improvement of Bitcoin and exploring alternate designs of cryptocurrencies. I had designed one of the first DAG-based consensus protocols, and I was into Bitcoin sidechains. But I was focused on the technical and security challenges, not very aware of the transformative social force that Bitcoin can be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in 2015 it all changed. I met Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar and Gabriel Kurman who taught me about how Bitcoin can uplift people from poverty through financial inclusion. I met Adrian Eidelman and Ruben Altman who had vast experience in software development and wanted to be part of the Bitcoin revolution. And also Adrian Garelik, who wanted to build a lasting Bitcoin community spirit. Together we built Rootstock, the first Bitcoin sidechain. And we never stopped building since then.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q3. What excites you the most about what you’re building?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A large part of my life I worked in computer security but what really gives me joy is algorithm design and optimizations. The computer security mindset is one of ordinary paranoia. Not very healthy. I like the mindset of discovery. Therefore I’m most excited by blockchain scalability, especially when it is connected with real use cases: how can this technology be stacked and built in layers to serve one billion users. I may get equally excited when saving a few microseconds in computation as well as watching a whole new scalability paradigm emerge. My recent work has been on storage rent, parallel transaction processing, and state database optimizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q4. Where do you see Rootstock in 3 years from now?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rootstock was built to last. It is strategically aligned with Bitcoin in many ways. It provides the most decentralized DeFi for Bitcoin platform as no other blockchain can. It incentivizes Bitcoin mining and it also provides tremendous value to Bitcoiners, although not all Bitcoiners can see it right now. Rootstock was built to be here in the next 20 years to support the Bitcoin security budget in case the Bitcoin subsidy and transaction fees cannot provide enough security. Regarding Rootstock’s position as a platform for financial inclusion, it brings unmatched value to the unbanked who may now transact in Rootstock using stablecoins collateralized in Bitcoin, without relying on centralized third parties. There are still risks related to the laws and regulations surrounding smart contract platforms that have not been defined.

This means that, while capital efficient, they do get the benefit of liquidations protecting depositors’ funds. On DeltaPrime users can easily deposit and borrow funds to increase the power of their usual DeFi investments. The minimum collateral ratio for these loans is 20%, allowing users to get up to 5x leverage on their assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"nv-iframe-embed\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"DeltaPrime x RedStone: novel DeFi needs novel Oracles\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hODllbEXdfU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Cooperation with RedStone</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The DeltaPrime and RedStone teams have been cooperating since the inception of both projects. The idea of DeltaPrime was conceived early, but there were simply no oracles available on the market that were fast, cheap, or reliable enough to launch the protocol. When RedStone oracles launched DeltaPrime&nbsp; to life. DeltaPrime was the first protocol to use RedStone oracles on mainnet. That’s why their full launch in December is a big thing for us too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Value proposition</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since DeltaPrime is allowing leverage on multiple tokens it needs constant information about the value of every token in the prime account. Thanks to an off-chain stream of nodes called “RedStone Cache Layer” there is no need to pay gas costs for new price data, and the data is being pushed on-chain only when it’s needed (for example during the liquidation). This is a perfect example of how our oracles can disrupt this industry enabling the formation of completely new DeFi products.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Questions to the DeltaPrime team</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>How do you use RedStone oracles in your protocol?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Because the solvency is insured by the system algorithmically we need to have up-to-date data feeds to perform all the checks around the solvency and to liquidate the account when it’s needed.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>What are the main advantages and benefits of using RedStone?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“So for us it’s the versatility of data feeds, we support leveraged farming and for that, we need to have pricing of LP tokens and this is not easy to find with the traditional oracle approach.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>From a builders perspective how hard is the integration and use of our oracles in your protocol, and how was the cooperation with our team?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“The integration wasn’t that hard, it’s a totally different approach than the normal one, so I encourage you all to go through the docs, but there are really good tutorials to understand how it all works. The cooperation was great, RedStone was always flexible and helpful to prepare the feeds that we need.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DeltaPrime channels:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://deltaprime.io/\">https://deltaprime.io/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeltaPrimeDefi\">https://twitter.com/DeltaPrimeDefi</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/9bwsnsHEzD\">https://discord.com/invite/9bwsnsHEzD</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RedStone channels:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://redstone.finance/\">https://redstone.finance/</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi\">https://twitter.com/redstone_defi</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46\">https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance\">https://github.com/redstone-finance</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/</a></p>\n","id":19,"urlQuery":"deltaprime-x-redstone-novel-defi-needs-novel-oracles"},{"class_article":"post-209 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-uncategorized layout-grid  ","link":"https://blog.redstone.finance/2022/11/18/redstonepowered-ep-4-zkx/","title":"#RedStonePowered ep.4: ZKX","description":"We are excited to announce that ZKX is now #RedStonePowered! ♦️ ZKX allows for the trading of Perpetual Swaps like never before.

Novel order book architecture optimized for high-speed and high-throughput scalability, while users retain ownership of their funds. Innovative Liquid Governance mechanism.<strong> </strong>Now unfolding full potential thanks to our Data Feeds!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What is ZKX?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>ZKX is the first perpetual futures exchange built on StarkNet. The protocol is designed to provide further scalability with a decentralized node network, elevated trading experience, and offer perpetual swaps and derivatives to any user on StarkNet and Ethereum. ZKX’s mission is to democratize access to global yields through its offerings to anyone, anywhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Cooperation with RedStone</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone is now one of the official data providers for ZKX’s launch! Our Data Feeds will be powering ZKX perps with reliable data from a vast variety of sources. Additionally, thanks to our Custom Data Feeds, ZKX can now work with assets that previously had limited usability because of the lack of proper data. Expect more info on the details from ZKX’s side closer to the testnet launch. <img draggable=\"false\" role=\"img\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\"👀\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f440.svg\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Questions to the ZKX team</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q1. How did you get into the web3 space?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eduard | Founder &amp; CEO</strong><br>I worked for venture capital funds in Asia and the United States alongside Naman. While working at SOSV, we discovered a massive opportunity in catering to users in emerging markets like Indonesia and India. We realized how many limitations they had in accessing financial opportunities. And this is how the idea of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3x34snh\">ZKX</a> was born –&nbsp; To help people in emerging markets gain access to opportunities that were previously unavailable to them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Naman | Co-founder &amp; COO</strong><br>I have experience in venture building and scaling startups and when I met Eduard at SOSV, he introduced me to the world of crypto. In 2020, when DeFi was picking up steam, we saw a gap in the market — which triggered the idea of ZKX. Eventually, we opted to work on ZK-Rollup technology because we thought that would be the most scalable way to target these emerging market users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vitaly | Co-Founder &amp; CTO</strong><strong><br></strong>I have been working in software engineering for almost 20 years. Like many other software engineers, I saw something unusual — Bitcoin and blockchain in 2010 and started tinkering with it. In the last 10 years I started trading and focused on early-stage start-ups and scale-ups in Web3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q2. What are the beginnings of ZKX?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>ZKX is the first perpetual futures exchange built on StarkNet that offers complex financial instruments as swaps. The protocol was created out of the idea that everyone should have access to investment opportunities, creating an equal playing field for people from different countries and backgrounds. In early 2022, ZKX received a grant from StarkWare Industries marking the beginning of a fruitful collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July this year ZKX announced their $4.5 Mn raise from investors including StarkWare, Amber Group, Huobi, Crypto.com, Hashkey Capital, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q3. What excites you the most about what you’re building?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are redefining the existing DeFi mechanisms and the goal is to build next-gen derivatives on Layer 2. Hedging and protection are key within volatile environments like crypto but there are limited mechanisms available. Perpetual swaps are one which help users insulate themselves in uncertain market situations. Yet, most option strategies are inaccessible to everyone and too complicated. We are excited about building new kinds of perpetual swaps that are necessary to simplify the experience for the user and help bring more access and equal opportunity to everyone in DeFi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>ZKX channels:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://zkx.fi/\">https://zkx.fi/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zkxprotocol\">https://twitter.com/zkxprotocol</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/exbVfzqG\">https://discord.gg/exbVfzqG</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/zkxcommunity\">https://t.me/zkxcommunity</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>RedStone channels:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://redstone.finance/\">https://redstone.finance/</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi\">https://twitter.com/redstone_defi</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46\">https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance\">https://github.com/redstone-finance</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/</a></p>\n","id":18,"urlQuery":"redstonepowered-ep-zkx"},{"class_article":"post-203 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-uncategorized layout-grid  ","link":"https://blog.redstone.finance/2022/10/21/streamr-x-redstone-changing-oracles-landscape-together/","title":"Streamr x RedStone: Changing Oracles landscape together","description":"During the last 6 months we have been using Streamr nodes as an essential part of RedStone oracles.

We would like to update how our cooperation is going, what have we learnt, and what has changed during the collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;So at the beginning let’s recall how we use streamr:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“RedStone nodes include a price requester module that fetches signed data from the Streamr Network and attaches it to meta-transactions before submitting them on-chain. When the transaction is executed on-chain, it can access the attached data. This mechanism eliminates the need to push data to the blockchain regularly, making the whole process more efficient and cost-effective.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a user needs to consume data, Redstone smart contract extracts the signed data with a timestamp, verifies it, and passes it to the target defi contract. Streamr Nodes store data for a short period of time and allow us to keep data off-chain, when it’s not needed, saving gas costs and at the same time preserving decentralization and security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past few months the way we use Streamr has changed – previously Streamr Nodes were used as additional data broadcasting channel, and now since it has proven to be a truly decentralized and reliable system, it has become our core channel for delivering data to end users. In the meantime we managed to get new capabilities from the use of Nodes by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Building a temporary storage layer of Streamr Nodes data – it is giving easy access to recent, verified data.</li><li>Adding data compression before broadcasting signed data packages to the Streamr Network which reduced the packet size by two times – this allowed us to achieve higher network bandwidth and more efficient data flow.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Streamr has enough bandwidth for all our needs, recent benchmarks have shown that basically any package with size up to 1mb has average transfer speed of 7s.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ctOqXo_BUHfwu3gyTvcocFmAgWn2Vq8rRO5SiLHW4-b9zAMncGQZe_Zzhtno_nNklq7DAhyYy1MyrYhgAOEvTj7U64Zb3vzB9hC5Gw4LZ6T8JT0BgyQ40AfoCsLx8-UQtMFe9YiTsExEzBG7Isqvq2mSnihk8RMEKeReq03gNXna78uFOKpAjUkzIw\" alt=\"\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now we are developing solutions to archive data from Streamr Nodes on Arweave chain – that will give us even more options for using this data (e.g. using historical data in DeFi protocols), and increase the significance of Streamr in our ecosystem even further. In addition together with the Streamr team we keep on thinking about new security measures to ensure data availability and DDoS protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, we’re very satisfied with the use of Streamr Network and excited that by adding new upgrades together with the Streamr team we manage to squeeze out as much potential as possible. We cannot wait to see how our cooperation develops in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","id":17,"urlQuery":"streamr-x-redstone-changing-oracles-landscape-together"},{"class_article":"post-200 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-partnership layout-grid  ","link":"https://blog.redstone.finance/2022/10/13/redstonepowered-ep-3-okc/","title":"#RedStonePowered ep.3: OKC","description":"We are excited to announce that OKC is now #RedStonePowered! ♦️ If you want to build a data-powered dApp on this EVM-compatible, Cosmos based, IBC… Read More »\n#RedStonePowered ep.3: OKC","autor":"by RedStone","date":"October 13, 2022","image":"https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0eHUJ0AQ-Gw_O8UVb-2.png","content":"\n<p>We are excited to announce that OKC is now <strong>#RedStonePowered!</strong> ♦️<img draggable=\"false\" role=\"img\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\"⚡\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/26a1.svg\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to build a data-powered dApp on this EVM-compatible, Cosmos based, IBC interoperable chain, look no further. We now provide the necessary data for it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What is OKC&nbsp;Network?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>OKC (OKX Chain) is an EVM-compatible L1 built on Cosmos with a focus on true interoperability (Inter-Blockchain Communication) and maximized performance. Thanks to high scalability, developers can build and scale with low gas fees. The OKC ecosystem and infrastructure, including the all-in-one multi-chain Web3 interface, enables a seamless experience for both developers and users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Advantages of&nbsp;OKC</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>● High Scalability &amp; Maximized Performance: Based on enhanced Tendermint and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus that can support up to 5000 Transactions per Second (TPS), Web3 applications shall reach their full potential at extremely low cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>● Enhanced Interoperability: OKC supports Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol that — together with the Tendermint consensus algorithm featuring instant finality — can be used to realize value transmission within the Cosmos ecosystem in seconds. Being EVM compatible, OKC allows developers to build projects without any learning cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>● Developer Friendly: OKC is completely open-source. Anyone can read it, check the progress, comment on it, and help build the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>● Secure: The OKC team offers a reliable smart contract auditing service, making it a genuinely decentralized protocol that avoids the centralization risks of most blockchain networks today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Cooperation with&nbsp;RedStone</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>RedStone now provides the OKC community with a cutting-edge oracle solution for the applications within the OKC ecosystem. Now OKX chain applications will be able to interact with our diverse data feeds covering cryptocurrencies, NFTs, equities, and much more. We are also ready to provide custom data feeds tailored to the applications’ needs. Non-standard data is our specialty and we want the OKC builders to leverage it to the fullest. All of that will enable them to create use cases limited only by their imagination.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Questions to the OKC&nbsp;team</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q1. How did you get into the web3 space?<br></strong>Nanfeng, from Product:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Back in 2011 while I was still a PhD candidate, I learned some information about blockchain and started mining BTC. However, not until 2018 did I formally become a Web3 product manager.</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Chai, Ecosystem:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Attended a Bitcoin event in Berlin in 2015, and got hooked on its simple yet beautiful idea. Totally went down the rabbit hole after two years when I joined Huobi to charge Wallet.</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q2. What are the beginnings of OKC? (a bit about your funding story)<br></strong>OKX and OKCoin have been around for more than 5 and 8 years respectively — it is about time for us to venture into building and contributing more to the web3 space. OKC was developed with true interoperability and maximized performance in mind right from the beginning, bringing siloed ecosystems together. We wanted to build a chain that would enable seamless experiences across both centralized and decentralized functions, and we are in a position to achieve that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q3. What excites you the most about what you’re building?<br></strong>OKC has achieved the highest TPS among all the EVM-compatible chains as well as Cosmos chains, and the record gets broken once in a while by our own developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q4. Where do you see OKC 3 years from now?<br></strong>OKC will serve as the bedrock to connect the centralized and decentralized ecosystems with maximum compatibility, enabling Web3 interactions at stunning speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>OKC channels</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Website:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://okx.com/okc\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://okx.com/okc</a><br>Web3 Multi-chain interface:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://okx.com/web3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://okx.com/web3</a><br>Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/OKCNetwork\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/OKCNetwork</a><br>Submit Project:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forms.gle/MqRiG5hKDENYgKBMA\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://forms.gle/MqRiG5hKDENYgKBMA</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>RedStone channels</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Website:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://redstone.finance/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://redstone.finance/</a><br>Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/redstone_defi</a><br>Discord:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46</a><br>GitHub:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/redstone-finance</a><br>LinkedIn:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/</a></p>\n","id":16,"urlQuery":"redstonepowered-ep-okc"},{"class_article":"post-194 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-redstone-oracles layout-grid  ","link":"https://blog.redstone.finance/2022/10/11/194/","title":"LensScore: On-chain reputation is the currency of the future.

Let’s think about some examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What if you could refine YouTube for a different application with the exact same content but a completely different recommendation algorithm? The new one would recommend only hyper-valuable deep-dive videos on topics of your interest (instead of empty clickbaits sucking up your time).</li><li>What if you could quickly turn quality content creation into a viable business model?&nbsp;<br>No more straining to get millions of empty subscribers. Now it makes perfect financial sense to create artisanal content for a group of superfans.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we are adding one more fundamental question to this list:&nbsp;<br>What if you could build your reputation based on your Decentralized Social Media activity?</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>The faults of current online reputation</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s face it, the Web2 online reputation is broken. First of all, you need to disclose your full identity to keep on gaining trust. Secondly, since the reputation gained on one platform is not transferable to another one — your level 7,211 Paladin on Forum A, does not matter in Forum B, as you cannot prove you’re the same user across two platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you wanted to stay within just one platform, there are still more problems to overcome. In order to make the reputation usable, you have to pass a very high threshold of recognizability. This is traditionally measured by the follower count. In other words, only when you reach a “critical mass of followers” can you leverage your reputation and start seeing tangible returns coming from it. For example, monetization of content (such as commercial partnerships, paid posts, etc.) on most platforms only starts when you reach tens of thousands of followers/subscribers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a moment let’s go beyond the concept of reputation based solely on followers within a single social media app. Let’s include more verticals (all coming from on-chain activity), and serve it in a machine-readable form that unlocks permissionless benefits in the decentralized financial system. Let’s make it transparent to let participants estimate the effort needed to get to returns they find satisfying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This concept opens up many interesting opportunities. Now you can create exclusive communities with permissionless access that can only be joined by members above X level of on-chain reputation. You can search for potential business partners by simply scanning an open and transparent database. You can get significantly better conditions for your collateralized loan based on your open and transparent reputation (or maybe even become eligible for an uncollateralized one?).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The above use cases can only be made possible because of some key assumptions. Such a measure of reputation has to be unified across different apps. Also, dApps and Smart Contracts have to be able to use it in a permissionless manner. That is exactly what we have built.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Introducing Lens&nbsp;Score</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>LensScore is a Web3 scoring Oracle based on data from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/LensProtocol\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lens Protocol</a>. It’s also our hackathon project for KyivTechSummit that won prizes in 2 different categories!<br>Here is how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We fetch data about Lens profiles like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lensfrens.xyz/stani.lens\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stani.lens</a>&nbsp;by retrieving statistics from GraphQL API,</li><li>We calculate the score based on the below 6 variables,</li><li>The Score is then available for Smart Contracts and Protocols.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The formula for score calculation can be described as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*pkmpUD0pmjgxYxNoJULA8Q.png\" alt=\"\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Where:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>tc</em> — total number of comments</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>tpo</em> — total number of posts</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>tpub</em> — total number of publications</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>tf</em> — total number of followers</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>tc</em> — total number of collects</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>tm</em> — total number of mirrors</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Nesxvc9RkjyVGnE2\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Lens Profile statistics with calculated Score</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A full description of our submission can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/lensscore-for-defi-lending-and-web3-interactions\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Please keep in mind that this algorithm was created solely for POC purposes during the hackathon. Our goal was to generally explore this idea without getting into too much detail i.e. in terms of exploit prevention. We believe that the potential it might have with a more sophisticated calculation layer underneath, i.e. by using Machine Learning models, is very promising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where do RedStone Oracles come into play? We pull on-chain data from Polygon-based Lens Protocol, calculate the score and make it available for anyone to integrate into a dApp or Smart Contract on 30+ chains (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@RedStone_Finance/cross-chain-oracles-how-redstone-tackles-it-7d086397b9ad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>&nbsp;you can see how it works under the hood). We have already gathered over 50 Lens profiles and calculated their scores. You can check them out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/tokens?selected-tab=13\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>&nbsp;(spoiler alert: surprisingly,&nbsp;<strong>stani.lens</strong>&nbsp;is not the one with the highest score<img draggable=\"false\" role=\"img\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\"👀\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f440.svg\">).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want us to calculate your Lens Score? Get it→&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc1DfhtULmDR6706geEahzlaCjN-oCgqqRpU9UTGDoOkQ8SAw/viewform?usp=sf_link\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>HERE</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Possible use&nbsp;cases</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal here was to convert reputation to a&nbsp;<em>variable</em>&nbsp;closely representing the possibilities which your reputation provides you with. We also wanted to create a way of rewarding active members of the web3 space, across different projects, areas of interest, or specific industries. Moreover, the goal was to do it in a very tangible way, allowing users to see their incremental progress at all levels of engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lens Protocol, being a cross-topic, cross-community, and cross-application data layer, appeared to be just the right environment for this concept. It doesn’t matter how you enjoy consuming your content, which applications built on top of Lens you prefer or what particular topics interest you most. If you take an active part in the ecosystem, you are building your reputation with every single contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we use that mechanism in a blockchain context? A couple of ideas come to mind in an instant:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>On-chain credit scoring — either used as a basic variable or as one of the variables in calculating the final credit score for overcollateralized or undercollateralized lending. Building on the premise of reputation being one of the most valuable assets in this space. This is definitely a great topic for a whole other article.</li><li>Anti-bot/Sybil protection, ‘lazy’ KYC for airdrops/allowlists — now you can prove you are not a bot while remaining anon. This gives us great tools for eliminating bots and enabling users to leverage their engagement.</li><li>Building exclusive communities/applications on top of Lens — want to join our dApp focused on sharing the most insightful Tokenomic materials? Prove your contribution to the Lens Ecosystem beforehand. The team behind such an application could come up with their own way of calculating LensScore to find the highest quality new joiners (thanks to us, the infrastructure is automatic — the Smart Contract won’t let you join unless you fulfill the conditions).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*--UbNWVxbtzndJtq\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Stani.lens profile with score and historical change over last&nbsp;hour</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Next steps</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To sum up, we see LensScore as an interesting tool for Builders to play with. We are currently in co-operation with the Lens &amp; Aave team about the further development of the project. Besides this, we will soon submit LensScore to the Aave Grants DAO as one of the revolutionary pieces in the Web3 trust puzzle. Our main goal is to serve this data on chain therefore we are open to cooperation with Builders willing to build, for example, a more sophisticated data calculation/data processing layer (or, perhaps, one tailored to some specific needs).

It is hard to predict if the future will be multichain as well but we need to provide tooling for the current situation. This is why many products, RedStone Oracles included, position themselves as cross-chain.</p>\n<h4><strong>Cross-chain oracles</strong></h4>\n<p>A question that often arises is how do oracles become cross-chain? Oracles are not responsible for exchanging information between networks but they can provide the same data to different blockchains at the same time. This is not a trivial problem because each network requires additional work and integration. What is more, if oracles are using storage contracts to keep up-to-date values usable for smart contracts, it gets extremely expensive. In this situation, scalability is severely limited and for this reason, most current oracle implementations concentrate on one network.</p>\n<p>In order to create truly cross-chain oracles, RedStone decided not to use storage contracts. This decision is one of the crucial factors in opening up a way to unparalleled scalability. So, how can we provide data to smart contracts since:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>they cannot natively communicate with the external world;</li>\n<li>there isn’t any other contract with the necessary information?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can achieve this by implementing a chain-specific connector that is applied on both the contract and client sides.</p>\n<h4>RedStone’s approach</h4>\n<p>Speaking of contracts, we have prepared <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/tree/main/packages/evm-connector#1-modifying-your-contracts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our own</a> which should be inherited by the user’s contract. In our contract, there are functions responsible for four major functionalities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>data extraction from calldata,</li>\n<li>data provider validation,</li>\n<li>timestamp validation,</li>\n<li>aggregation of data from multiple providers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These functionalities allow us to use verified data from multiple providers in smart contracts. The only question here is how information appears in the contracts’ calldata.</p>\n<p>On the client side, we prepared a <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/tree/main/packages/evm-connector#1-modifying-your-contracts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">library</a> that is responsible for attaching specially prepared data to transaction calldata. Currently, it is mostly focused on ethers.js and works as a wrapper on a contract instance. Each time you interact with the wrapped contract our library fetches information from the RedStone cache layer and adds it at the end of the transaction data. Later, the transaction is sent to the contract which, if extended by our contract, can extract information and use it for any on-chain purpose.</p>\n<p>The whole process described above is presented on the graph:</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*PIE1AXTOI2bCkzIn\" data-width=\"1035\" data-height=\"435\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>At a top level, transferring data to a contract requires packing an extra payload to a user’s transaction and processing the message on-chain.</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>At RedStone we strongly believe that getting rid of the storage contract is the right way forward to build the next-generation of oracles that offer cross-chain functionality by design and unparalleled scalability. However, this process of passing data to contracts is not the only thing that differentiates us from other oracle providers.

But what exactly happens under the hood? Are there any limitations associated with it? Let’s take a closer look!</strong></p>\n<h3>What are lending markets and how do they&nbsp;work?</h3>\n<p>The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols over the last two years have been one of the greatest success stories of crypto. With a Total Value Locked of $61.4 billion (DefiLlama as of Aug 2022), it is easy to understand why this once niche area of crypto has garnered a lot of attention. However, as many crypto evangelists know, this is just the beginning. DeFi aims to completely overhaul the financial landscape by reducing barriers to entry, ensuring faster transaction speeds that result in massive cost savings and providing crypto holders with the opportunity to utilize their idle assets. Every legacy industry has a responsibility to keep up with new technology trends or face oblivion. On its current trajectory, DeFi is on course to have a massive impact on traditional finance.</p>\n<p>The most popular area of DeFi to date are Lending Markets. Lending Markets use DLT technology and smart contracts to enable peer-to-peer lending through the innovative use of a protocol that eliminate the risk usually associated with traditional finance.</p>\n<p>In its simplest form, DeFi users become lenders by depositing their coins into a DeFi-based smart contract for which in return they receive a minted token native to the protocol (eg DAO, aToken, cTokens). Such tokens can be redeemed at any time and the rate of exchange between the deposited and native tokens represents the APY which is determined by the ratio between the supplied and borrowed tokens in a particular market.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the application are borrowers who are able to access funds thanks to the overcollateralization of their own digital assets that they have deposited. There is a wide variety of lending protocols, each providing a unique suite of products and services. However, the most popular type is called the liquidity pool model.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fpD4aFZITd7qLl2x\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>Using ETH as collateral allows the DeFi trader to borrow DAI on a lending platform</p>\n<p>There are a number of benefits to this decentralized, peer-to-peer lending model. Firstly every borrower has access to unlimited liquidity if they have the assets available to collateralize the loan. Secondly, the promise of healthy rates of APY encourages the crypto holder to make use of their assets and prevent them from sitting idle. Finally, because the model is peer-to-peer and written in code there is no need for lengthy and exhaustive AML and KYC checks thereby lowering barriers of entry and enabling anyone to participate.</p>\n<h3>Why lending markets need&nbsp;oracles</h3>\n<p>There are many reasons why oracles are essential to the development of not only DeFi but any smart contract and the further development of blockchain as a whole. In its simplest terms, on-chain code used in a smart contract is unable to process real-world data. Oracles exist as essential middleware which enable smart contracts and blockchains to connect with external resources.</p>\n<p>This combination of smart contracts, blockchains, and oracles is often referred to as <em>hybrid smart contracts</em>. This kind of ecosystem is well positioned to enable the development of advanced blockchain applications. Oracles act as the <em>data on-ramp</em> to blockchains and smart contracts. Without oracles a blockchain is a toothless tiger akin to a computer not connected to the internet.</p>\n<p>With that being said, oracles are more than just essential data feeds. In the lending market model, oracles act as a filtration and authentication medium verifying the integrity and security of information critical in the execution of high-worth contracts. Lending market protocols need accurate and current market price data supplied in a timely manner to enable lenders and borrowers to make effective decisions. Furthermore, borrowers must prove evidence of their ability to collateralize any potential loan.</p>\n<p>As many lending markets are composable in nature it is essential that oracles are able to process and connect data which enable further smart contracts to be built allowing for continued connectivity and interoperability. Efficient, cost effective and versatile oracles are essential to the continued development of the DeFi lending protocol. Accountability, transparency and trustlessness can all be achieved through the integration of effective oracle design.</p>\n<h3>Examples of lending markets and how they source&nbsp;data</h3>\n<p>Every lending protocol needs access to the highest quality market data to open, settle, and liquidate undercollateralized loans at prices that are both globally accurate and fair to the market. Without accuracy and fairness, consumer protection is in danger.</p>\n<p>There are a number of successful lending protocols on the market to date but, for the purpose of this discussion, we will look at two of the biggest names — Aave and Compound.</p>\n<p>Aave is an Ethereum-based, open source, non custodial, decentralized lending platform which offers users over 100 ways to integrate while providing access to 31 different liquidity pools. With a total value locked of $6.46 billion, it is essential that Aave customers have access to trusted, secure and accurate data at all times.</p>\n<p>Aave currently uses Chainlink decentralized oracles, aggregators and price feeds which enable the platform to update price frequency results using a liquidation strategy. This means that prices supplied are refreshed every time the deviation crosses a certain threshold differing across assets with the maximum being 2%. If the returned price by the Chainlink aggregator is ≤0 then the call is forwarded to a fallback oracle which is owned by Aave Governance. The Aave protocol uses a series of functions to produce asset prices that are returned in the base currency of the Aave market.</p>\n<p>Once market data has been received via Chainlink aggregators, Aave makes use of a ‘Lending Pool Data Provider’ contract which performs computation and provides data for the lending pool itself. In particular the contract:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calculates user balance in equivalent ETH to assess the borrowing limit of a user and their current position health.</li>\n<li>Calculates the average loan to value and the average liquidation ratio.</li>\n<li>Aggregates data from the Lending Pool Core in order to provide quality data to the Lending Pool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although Aave is one of the biggest protocols providing peer-to-peer lending, the site only has support for 30 tokens with the majority of trades using Ethereum. The reasons behind this are twofold. Firstly, on-chain storage is expensive and hard to scale. This will no doubt create problems going forward. Secondly, due to the high costs involved, updates are infrequent which deters any opportunity to integrate more volatile and less popular tokens. RedStone Finance data oracles addresses both issues with its innovative, on-demand data delivery scheme.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, there are numerous other lending markets, all of which need access to accurate, timely, and trusted data. One of them, Compound, uses Chainlink Price Feeds to supply the ‘Comptroller smart contract’ used by Compound. This price data used by Compound is known as Open Price Data and is open source, hosted on GitHub and maintained by the community.</p>\n<p>The Compound smart contract uses a ‘View Contract’ which verifies that all prices fall within an acceptable boundary of time-weighted average prices of the token/ETH pair via Uniswap v2 (referred to as the Anchor Price). Furthermore, the Chainlink price feed submits prices for each native token through an individual ValidatorProxy contract making each VP the only valid reporter for the underlying asset price.</p>\n<p>It is clear from the two examples above that the use of data oracles is prevalent in the lending market space. APIs allow oracles to connect with external sources and aggregate the data before it is made available to the customer. Other techniques such as dismissing outliers and accessing numerous sources ensure that any data feed is accessible. Some oracles utilize a special mechanism to resolve disputes around data validity, RedStone included. With that in mind, any modern data oracle needs to not only supply accurate and timely data in an efficient manner but also must act as a filtration mechanism that identifies and rejects any data which is suspicious or misconfigured.</p>\n<h3>Potential of new lending markets that could be created on top of RedStone&nbsp;data</h3>\n<p>Lending markets have been a major contributor to the success story of DeFi. Although many of the original market leaders are still active today, the lessening returns for borrowers and the high rates of collateral required are losing their attraction for many. However, there are a number of innovative products in the pipeline which threaten to reignite the lending market.</p>\n<p>Let’s go back for a moment to Aave as it was one of the first DeFi protocols to provide Flash Loans where borrowing and repayment occur within one Ethereum transaction. This is one area that, given it gets enough traction, could create a significant demand for accessible data. However, that being said the pain of numerous Flash Loan-enabled hacks is still fresh in our minds. A good example of that is the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-27/defi-protocol-cream-finance-loses-130-million-in-latest-hack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cream Finance hack</a> where, by exploiting a vulnerability in the platform’s lending system, hackers were able to drain it using Flash Loans.</p>\n<p>Another interesting trend in the lending market is that of the Stability Pool. This concept was introduced by Liquity Protocol and allows holders of the native stablecoin — LUSD — to contribute to the liquidity source that enables debt repayment from liquidated loans. Users who contribute to the Stability Pool make liquidation ‘gains’ and receive LQTY tokens as an extra reward.</p>\n<p>Finally, Hubble Protocol allows users to earn a yield on any collateral locked into a smart contract. Running on the Solana network, Hubble supports a wide variety of assets that can be used as collateral and generate yield through the minting of native stablecoin USDH.</p>\n<p>All three of these examples would rely heavily on efficient, fast, and effective data. Oracles have the potential to provide the backbone to a new class of decentralized lending protocols. As long as the data is trusted, secure and accessible, the opportunities for future application development are endless.</p>\n<p>The benefits of using RedStone Finance for data aggregation are many. In particular, RedStone uses a higher frequency of price collection and is therefore able to support less liquid and more volatile tokens allowing for more opportunities to scale than most of its competitors. Also, RedStone stands apart from its competitors in its ability to dramatically reduce storage costs by ‘fetching’ the data when required rather than storing it on a blockchain. This mechanism considerably reduces storage space and its associated costs. So much so that it is calculated that RedStone Finance is able to call 1gb worth of data at 1:50,0000th of the cost of storing the data on the Ethereum blockchain. By calling the data when it is needed rather than taking up valuable storage space we can provide a more cost-effective and energy-efficient data access solution than any of the nearest competitors.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>At RedStone we are on a mission to build the next generation of Oracles. Our solution has an unrivaled ability to exert significant control over any new data listings. Result? The flexibility to follow any emerging market trends, alongside substantial cost savings, allows us to stay at the frontier of a new wave of Decentralised Finance.</p>\n<p><strong>Join us on the journey!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> |<a href=\"http://redstone.finance/discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Discord</a> |<a href=\"https://redstone.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Website</a> |<a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Github</a> |<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Linkedin</a></p>\n","id":12,"urlQuery":"how-do-defi-lending-markets-use-oracles-to-source-data"},{"class_article":"post-38 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-partnership category-uncategorized layout-grid  ","link":"https://blog.redstone.finance/2022/08/18/redstonepowered-ep-2-evmos/","title":"#RedStonePowered ep.2: Evmos","description":"We are excited to share that Evmos is now #RedStonePowered!

If you are thinking about building a data-powered dApp and want to combine EVM convenience with Cosmos interoperability — Evmos + RedStone is now the way to go. Let’s take a closer look!</p>\n<h3><strong>What is&nbsp;Evmos?</strong></h3>\n<p>Evmos is bringing the world of Ethereum-based applications and assets to the interoperable networks of the Cosmos ecosystem, all while aligning developer and user incentives. Leveraging the Cosmos SDK, Evmos is one of the first IBC-compatible (<a href=\"https://blog.cosmos.network/deep-dive-how-will-ibc-create-value-for-the-cosmos-hub-eedefb83c7a0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inter Blockchain Communication protocol</a>) EVM-based blockchain, bringing composability, interoperability, and fast finality to Ethereum.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cooperation with&nbsp;RedStone</strong></h3>\n<p>RedStone now provides the Evmos community with a cutting-edge oracle solution for the applications within the Evmos ecosystem. We are also one of the first oracle providers to offer the $EVMOS price feed. Now Evmos applications will be able to interact with our diverse data feeds covering cryptocurrencies, NFTs, equities and much more. It doesn’t stop there as we will also provide custom data feeds tailored specifically to the applications’ needs. Non-standard data is our specialty and we want the Evmos builders to leverage it to the fullest. All of that will enable them to create use cases limited only by their imagination. On the other hand, simplifying EVM app development is at the core of the Evmos mission thus integrating RedStone is a step further in this direction.</p>\n<h3><strong>Questions to the Evmos&nbsp;team</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Q1.

Today we’d like to shed some light on data aggregation, which is one of the main ways for improving the quality of oracle services. Data aggregation is a process of collecting different values (usually from different sources) and summarizing them (usually to a single value). A simple example is collecting price data for ETH/USD pair from several exchanges and calculating the average value. But why is it so important and how can a correctly picked aggregation method protect your DeFi protocol from being hacked? Scroll down to learn more <img draggable=\"false\" role=\"img\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\"⬇️\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/2b07.svg\"></p>\n<h3>Why data aggregation</h3>\n<p>The quality of data delivered by an oracle service depends on two main criteria:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Data availability</strong> — which means that the oracle data should be always available for end users (or smart contracts) and should be updated with the promised frequency</li>\n<li><strong>Data correctness</strong> — it may be defined in different ways and usually depends on the type of data. E.g. correctness of objective data (like results of the given football match) can be easily verified, but with less-objective data (like ETH token price denominated in USD) it can be way more difficult to define correctness</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Data aggregation improves the quality of the oracle data and helps oracles meet the requirements in many ways. First of all, aggregating data from different sources increases the value correctness, because even if some small subset of sources eventually corrupts it should not corrupt the aggregated value. Besides that, the aggregated value usually represents a “more fair” or “more correct” value. Additionally, aggregation improves data availability, because even if some sources stop working — the oracle service will still be able to function properly.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned in the previous articles, the main product-market fit for oracles today is the provision of pricing data, which is very useful for creating synthetic and derivative assets, insurance, lending, and many other protocols. That’s why this article is mainly focused on the methods of aggregating price values.</p>\n<h3>Average price&nbsp;value</h3>\n<p>The first aggregation algorithm that comes to mind is calculating the mean value. It is very simple and may look quite “fair”but it actually has a significant disadvantage, because it is not resistant to manipulation by even a small subset of corrupted sources. For example, assume that you want to get the ETH/USD value from 5 different exchanges, where 4 of them claim that the current price is around $2000, but one of them insists that it’s only $1. Then the average value is ~$1600, which is too deviated and can not be considered correct. That’s why usually mean value calculation, as well as other aggregation methods, are combined with an <a href=\"https://docs.diadata.org/documentation/methodology/exchangeprices/ir-interquartile-range-filter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interquartile Range Filter</a>, which helps to filter out outliers and market manipulations.</p>\n<figure><img data-width=\"1190\" data-height=\"624\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*C9PgoLKeP6bLETu7\"></figure>\n<h3>Median price&nbsp;value</h3>\n<p>There is another approach, which uses a median value calculation. It’s way better than the average value and definitely more resistant to manipulations by corrupted sources. However, even this method cannot be considered a perfect way to calculate price value. As an example, assume that you take the same ETH/USD value from one large crypto exchange ($100m daily trading volume on ETH/USD market) and 4 small ones (~$10k daily trading volume on ETH/USD market), and the large exchange provides value $2000, but all the small ones — less than $1900. Then the aggregated median value, in this case, will be less than $1900, but, as you can guess, it’s not close enough to the “real” market value.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"843\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*4SWB_jqOHJYH2sfe\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://app.redstone.finance/</a></figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Volume-Weighted Average Price&nbsp;(VWAP)</h3>\n<p>The next, and one of the best, aggregation method is the volume-weighted average price calculation. As the name suggests, this is a trade-based price determination that takes into account the different volumes of trades in different sources. The more trading volume a source has — the bigger the weight of its price value. Sometimes, VWAP is also combined with the Interquartile Range Filter to filter out outliers (see <a href=\"https://docs.diadata.org/documentation/methodology/exchangeprices/vwapir-volume-weighted-average-price-with-interquartile-range-filter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VWAPIR</a>).</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning, that thanks to the easy liquidity calculation on Decentralized Exchanges (like Uniswap, Sushiswap, PancakeSwap, and others), it is also possible to calculate the Liquidity-Weighted Average Price (LWAP) aggregated from multiple decentralized exchanges, which has similar advantages to the VWAP.</p>\n<figure><img data-width=\"1184\" data-height=\"626\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*EQTlBQ-pGVEsLBEs\"></figure>\n<h3>Time-weighted Average Price&nbsp;(TWAP)</h3>\n<p>Another common method for price aggregation is based on weighted average price, weights of which are defined by the time criterion. This is especially useful for calculating price values based only on decentralized exchanges. Many DEXes even offer their own TWAP-based oracle solutions (example: <a href=\"https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/core-concepts/oracles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Uniswap TWAP oracle</a>). But besides DEX-based oracles, this method can be used to make market manipulation harder in case of a limited amount of data sources. We, at RedStone, use TWAPs to make the pricing data of low-liquidity assets more stable and reliable.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"924\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*d4RKhTMYqyCe2491\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.tradingview.com/</a></figcaption></figure>\n<h3>So, what method is the&nbsp;best?</h3>\n<p>The ideal price value actually depends on the requested order (amount, buy/sell type) and it should take into account order books on each available exchange with all related fees. This is quite difficult to calculate. Fortunately, <strong>a sufficiently good price value </strong>does not need to be ideal by definition. And some combinations of aggregation algorithms described above may work great for the majority of use cases in the DeFi space. Nevertheless, it is very important to understand all potential risks before building a DeFi protocol that relies on pricing data from oracles and select the best aggregation method (or methods) for your case. <strong>Feel free to reach out to us, and we’ll be happy to help you with it <img draggable=\"false\" role=\"img\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\"😉\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f609.svg\"></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>At RedStone we are on a mission to build the next generation of Oracles.

The subject was summarized and made more approachable in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@RedStone_Finance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the previous article</a>. Today, we are proud to present a feature that we have recently added to the RedStone ecosystem, one which makes our oracles outstandingly flexible. We have called this portal <strong>Custom URL Oracles </strong>— and it is a powerful tool for Web3 projects that enables disruption and experimentation at an early stage, especially during hackathons.</p>\n<p><strong>The future is Custom</strong><br>\nThe first question with a new feature is often: why and what for. The same principle applies here. Currently, in the Web3 ecosystem, the vast majority of projects originate in the DeFi space. This means that most of the oracles concentrate on asset prices, tokens, stablecoins or synthetics. But what if someone comes up with a brilliant project idea that requires another type of data i.e. volume, weather or sports data? We all generate massive amounts of data every day and some part of it could be useful in Web3 projects. With this concept at the forefront of our minds, we have come up with the idea of <strong>RedStone</strong> <strong>Custom URL Oracles</strong>. The main goal behind this idea is to make oracles data agnostic and be able to provide as many kinds of data to the blockchain as possible. Naturally, we must impose some minor restrictions to keep the solution robust.</p>\n<p><strong>How it all works<br>\n</strong>Before we jump in, let’s briefly recall how RedStone oracles work (if you need more detailed information on that, be sure to check <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2-yE2U9lDo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>). RedStone software is divided into two main parts. The first part is a network of nodes that are responsible for fetching data from external sources and broadcasting it to the decentralized cache layer. The second part is the EVM-connector, which takes data from the decentralized cache layer and adds signed and serialized information to a transaction that is later sent to <strong>any EVM blockchain that a user wants to</strong>, be it Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, or Fantom. Next comes the flexibility of our infrastructure — our nodes can fetch data from any source and provide it to the EVM-connector. And this is exactly what <strong>Custom URL Oracles </strong>do. Users define what data is obtained and what could be used in smart contracts.<br>\nIn order to make everything simpler, we’ve prepared a <a href=\"https://custom-urls-manifest-updater.redstone.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fancy UI</a> for creating new custom URLs.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"912\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5rw8UOljF53AXeYY\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fancy UI</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The only things required are the URL to API from which data would be fetched and a <a href=\"https://jsonpath.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JSON path</a><strong> </strong>describing the way the desired value would be extracted from the API’s JSON response. As it can be seen, API response must be in JSON and formatted in a manner so that the JSON path can dig into the expected value. More detailed instructions on how to create a new Custom URL can be found at the end of this article. After creating a Custom URL it appears on the main page and is ready to be used with the EVM-connector like <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-evm-connector#-getting-started\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">every other asset</a>.

To get you up to speed, we are continuing our partner series with introductions of the latest protocols, utilizing RedStone to leverage their use cases. Now, the series gets a brand new hashtag #RedStonePowered, proudly representing the growth of the RedStone ecosystem. We can assure you that you will see more and more of it in the near future!</p>\n<p>Today, we present to you a brief introduction of our latest partner UniLend as well as a bit of behind-the-scenes material directly from its founding team. All of the necessary resources for further reading are also available below. Ladies and gentlemen, meet UniLend!</p>\n<p><strong>What is UniLend?<br>\n</strong>UniLend is a multichain permissionless Lending &amp; Borrowing protocol for all ERC20 tokens. Whereas other DeFi protocols support only a limited number of assets, anyone can list any asset on UniLend’s supported blockchains (currently Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain and Moonriver) to access comprehensive DeFi functionality for those assets. This includes decentralized trading, lending/borrowing, and the industry’s most cost-effective flash loans. The main functionalities of the protocol include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DeFi Lending &amp; Borrowing</strong>&nbsp;<br>\nUniLend utilizes a permissionless listing mechanism. This unique tool will allow users to lend, borrow and collateralize any tokens they have. Users can enable their token’s functionality for lending to get an interest rate and borrowing to pay an interest rate.</li>\n<li><strong>DeFi Flash Loans</strong>&nbsp;<br>\nUniLend will be the first DeFi protocol to provide permissionless listing for flash loans. Additionally, UniLend’s chain agnostic nature is well positioned to make it a pioneering flash loans protocol on many networks.</li>\n<li><strong>Permissionless Listing </strong><br>\nUniLend will empower users by allowing them to list any token without requiring permission from any authority, so that they may provide liquidity for, and trade any crypto asset they want.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cooperation with RedStone<br>\n</strong>Redstone is now supporting UFT (native token of the UniLend ecosystem) price feeds on all EVM-compatible chains. The goal? Enabling a wide range of DeFi applications to integrate UFT quickly and securely into their ecosystem thus increasing UFT utility across DeFi space.</p>\n<p>You can take a closer look at the price feed here:&nbsp;<br>\n<a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/UFT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/UFT</a></p>\n<p>For UniLend, our partnership is also a major advancement towards launching UniLend V2 OMNIS. This update is going to bring numerous DeFi innovations such as Isolated Dual Asset Lending Pools, Non-Fungible Liquidity positions, Lossless Treasury Management, Borrowing against the Treasury for DAOs and much more.&nbsp;<br>\nWant to learn more about that? Here is a great article to get started ​​→ <a href=\"https://unilend.medium.com/insider-series-overview-highlighting-unilend-v2-omnis-innovative-features-1c30f24fc0b8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LINK</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Questions to the UniLend team</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How did you get into the web3 space?<br>\n</strong>Prior to founding UniLend Finance, our CEO &amp; Co-Founder Chandresh Aharwar led the Marketing &amp; Strategy position at Polygon (previously known as Matic Network). The idea behind UniLend came when he realized how difficult it was to get the MATIC token listed on AMMs, DEXs, and lending/borrowing platforms. We were seeking a solution, and so UniLend idea was born along with two founding members, CTO Suryansh Kumar and CPO Tarun Malik.</p>\n<p>Existing major DeFi platforms such as Aave, Compound and Uniswap offer lending and borrowing functionality to limited tokens ~ supporting less than 30 assets for functionality. This restricts the majority of assets in participation in the DeFi ecosystem, leaving a huge gap<strong> </strong>(more than 9000 cryptocurrencies). UniLend Finance is bridging that gap by combining the decentralization aspect of enabling any ERC20 to be utilized as collateral for lending &amp; borrowing. UniLend vision is to make every digital asset productive in the crypto space.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the beginnings of UniLend?<br>\n</strong>UniLend successfully raised $3.1M in Seed and Private Sale Rounds. We’re backed by some of the leading Venture Capitalists in the industry, some of whom are Woodstock Fund, 3Commas, AU21 Capital, Coin98 Ventures and Krypital Group. Along with strong VCs, UniLend has some of the leaders supporting us including Sandeep Nailwal &amp; Jaynti Kanani (Co-Founders of Polygon), Danish Chaudhry (Head of Bitcoin.com Exchange) &amp; many more.</p>\n<p><strong>What excites you the most about what you’re building?<br>\n</strong>We’re building the most exciting project in the DeFi space. We believe the next evolution in DeFi is the inclusion of not only any participant but the inclusion of any asset which users wish to utilize. UniLend is making this a reality. It’s been 1 year since our v1 permissionless lending and our flash loans protocols went live on 4 major blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, BSC and Moonriver.<br>\nAs our v2 OMNIS launch approaches closer, UniLend is bringing permissionless lending and borrowing protocol for all ERC20 assets. We are developing a Futuristic Base Layer for all DeFi applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do you see UniLend in 3 years from now?<br>\n</strong>UniLend’s vision is to build a Futuristic Base Layer for all DeFi applications. Since UniLend v2 OMNIS is permission-less, open-source, and integrable, projects can integrate with our protocol to utilize lending &amp; borrowing utility and build &amp; integrate more services on top of it.<br>\nThis version expands our potential user base exponentially to the whole crypto space with a new and bigger vision. We estimate that allowing more cryptocurrencies to participate in the DeFi free market via permission-less listings could potentially increase the liquidity of the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>UniLend channels:<br>\n</strong>Website:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqazBlS3hHNUV2Vzd3dnlOSVItWmFWc2VvVm0yd3xBQ3Jtc0tuYjc2RVhma0JUbTEyRWV0aXpmZ2tNN3lKUU94R3MwOWVEazdDT29LalhtZUJJaWo2YUt2ZkJPQ2hMb0NQclBUUEVUQkNGc1FVRXVJWVVIcVFMelRuQUJBOXdwTDNvSWFNME83NE5ZblgwV1g2eGRSdw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Funilend.finance%2F&amp;v=I_r9fHrErJw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> https://unilend.finance/</a><br>\nTelegram:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa05ibndGS0dfS0lKMUp2RThxaWY3aVhGdlRzZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttZEJ4TlpKdUtaZ0hnWWgxemRGeUcySGJpUDNrdndkY3pwcXBWZnhod1R4UzNDbXFGblZwQnRKeUVKdUJKaEphMWVqelc0c2pyTlJGeUY4ZE1SNm5HTXJKdmxrS1dHeTNveXVtNWphZXJFSFFGd0syMA&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2FUniLendFinance&amp;v=I_r9fHrErJw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> https://t.me/UniLendFinance</a><br>\nAnnouncements:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0lYalNHdk5oMDV6RVRXR1habWF4dURsbjdsd3xBQ3Jtc0ttMVBkdTY0MHZUaFp3czdFVk5uZ1dyRVdNaVI3OFItWkZwMmQ3UGREYU9oQVBraDZqejdUdFZtUXdRRklpUGJPa29LQ1MzY29JVXRaNVRqVkVMTmdXYjZJY05veWhCNUlHMkN5N3JMSVh2YmxzOWN2bw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2FUniLendAnnouncement&amp;v=I_r9fHrErJw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> https://t.me/UniLendAnnouncement</a><br>\nTwitter:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbTU2bjNyV2hlOU1ncno2YUxMVjhDRkdqV3FNd3xBQ3Jtc0treDlIVzgyZ2Y1cDNNa010Q1JUOG94RFVCZXYtRUxRWGx1YnpKc1U1U0RvM2Y1MTdoU2NFTGF6YmRyM1F5ZEx0TUU1cHRNaHR1cmhGQkZmekdzdE1GbFhpSTU0UVRrTUUyOHhjR1A2X2Frc0JmT3BpQQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2FUniLendAnnouncement&amp;v=I_r9fHrErJw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> https://t.me/UniLendAnnouncement</a><br>\nReddit:<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UniLend/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> https://www.reddit.com/r/UniLend/</a><br>\nGithub:<a href=\"https://github.com/UniLend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> https://github.com/UniLend</a><br>\nInstagram:<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/unilendfinance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> https://www.instagram.com/unilendfinance/<br>\n</a>Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/UniLendFinance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/c/UniLendFinance</a></p>\n<p><strong>RedStone channels:<br>\n</strong>Website: <a href=\"https://redstone.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://redstone.finance/</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/redstone_defi</a><br>\nDiscord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46</a><br>\nGitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/redstone-finance</a><br>\nLinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/</a></p>\n","id":8,"urlQuery":"redstonepowered-ep-unilend"},{"class_article":"post-36 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-redstone-oracles category-uncategorized layout-grid  ","link":"https://blog.redstone.finance/2022/08/03/oracle-attacks-1-inverse-finance-15m-stolen/","title":"Oracle Attacks #1 — Inverse Finance, $15M stolen","description":"We are starting off our new mini-series about important Oracle Hacks and Manipulations.

The targeted protocol is Inverse Finance — a ‘decentralised bank’ providing numerous DeFi services such as collateralised lending. Let’s dive in!</p>\n<p><strong>Description of the attack</strong></p>\n<p>A professionally executed hack allowed an anonymous actor to manipulate the price of $INV and help themselves to an exclusive deal from the ETH-based lending protocol. They were able to submit collateral in the flash-pumped asset and receive a loan in other tokens worth orders of magnitude more than the fair price of the collateral.</p>\n<p>How exactly did it go? Let’s break it down together with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bertcmiller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@bertcmiller</a>, who specified the following steps in his post-mortem<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bertcmiller/status/1510246695929532417\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> analysis</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hacker withdraws 901 Eth from Tornado Cash.</li>\n<li>Using Disperse.app, the hacker transfers 1.5 Eth to 241 clean addresses in order to deploy 5 different smart contracts.</li>\n<li>Hacker swaps 500 eth to 1.7k INV through Sushi INV-WETH pool, increasing the INV price by approximately x50 due to low liquidity.</li>\n<li>Hacker begins sending numerous malicious transactions to Inverse Finance to be the first to get into the next block.</li>\n<li>The Inverse Finance ends up using SushiSwap TWAP as a <strong>(single) oracle</strong>. The price returned by the oracle is extremely inflated.</li>\n<li>Finally, the hacker manages to deposit 1.7k INV as collateral (at $644k fair price) and borrow $15.6M in the form of 1588 ETH, 94 WBTC, 4M DOLA, 39.3 YFI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The precision of execution, the plan’s structure, and extensive knowledge of blockchain quirks demonstrate that the actors behind this exploit were no amateurs.&nbsp;<br>\n<em>One of the most MEV aware hacks I’ve seen</em> as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bertcmiller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@bertcmiller</a> put it.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bertcmiller/status/1510284763332071427\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deeper dive</a> into the details amplifies the unique nature of this hack:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The attacker managed to hold an oracle’s price at an insane level across multiple blocks.</li>\n<li>The transaction to manipulate the oracle price was submitted in block N (14506358) as a bundle (transactions sent directly to miners, without going through the mempool) so arbitrage bots didn’t see it in the mempool and couldn’t bring the price for block N back in line.</li>\n<li>In block N+1 the price was arbitraged back. However, the oracle still used the price from block N.</li>\n<li>The attacker spammed the Inverse Finance contract to make sure the exploit was also executed in the block N+1 at N block price.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to mention that such an attack is not risk-free for the attacker. This particular attack involved the initial injection of 901 ETH ($2.7M at that time) in order to manipulate the price. This deposit may have been lost if something went wrong along the way. The development of the technology behind oracles, especially in attack prevention, is crucial as it significantly increases the risk, driving down the expected return of such a procedure. The end goal is to make the viability negative. This means that such an attack would become economically irrational.</p>\n<p><strong>The cause of the malfunction</strong></p>\n<p>Using a single price oracle based on a relatively low liquidity pool of assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Lessons learned</strong></p>\n<p>If Inverse Finance hadn’t used a single price oracle, the attack would have been significantly more difficult and the capital requirements, in order to execute it, would have made it too risky to begin with. The protocols should always opt for multiple data sources while using oracles.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>At RedStone we are on a mission to build the next generation of Oracles.

Today we are diving deeper into this topic, providing you with a comprehensive overview of what has already been done and what areas still need to be covered. Let’s begin!</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons behind the problem<br>\n</strong>Blockchains operate in isolated environments and are not naturally able to communicate with the outside world or other blockchains. This characteristic, apart from being a severe limitation, is also a crucial aspect of ensuring security. The oracle acts as a middleware solution whose role is to <em>connect</em> the blockchain with the outside world. It achieves that goal by providing all the data needed to build complex blockchain applications and enable real-life use cases.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"500\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5P5YEOlmL7xJlJoNyS9_FA.gif\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oracle call lifecycle</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This naturally revolves around financial aspects (i.e. creating tokens based on real-world data) but is generally applicable to a large spectrum of fields, from supply chain management to entertainment. At first sight, oracles may seem like a complete contradiction to blockchain principles. For instance, if a blockchain application requires data from a centralised source such as an oracle, then it can no longer be called <em>decentralised</em>. The trick here is to hit two birds with one stone — to be able to inject the real-world data onto the chain in a decentralised way that will not pose any risks to the application or protocol built on the blockchain. That is what the Oracle Problem is all about.</p>\n<p><strong>Defining The Oracle Problem<br>\n</strong>One of the first mentions of this term can be found in a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2p78kd/the_oracle_problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reddit Post</a> from late 2014, an era before the Ethereum environment for smart contracts was launched. In the post, the author shares their thoughts on the lack of decentralisation in early applications of oracles. Certainly, a fascinating read from today’s perspective. A high-level definition of the Oracle Problem can be found in an <a href=\"https://jimmysong.medium.com/the-truth-about-smart-contracts-ae825271811f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> written by Jimmy Song:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>There’s a need for the digital world to “know” about the physical world. This is known as the “Oracle problem”.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The “lack of external connectivity” of blockchains is also used as the basic definition in materials created by Chainlink, the biggest player so far in the oracle market. <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/oracles-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brian Curran</a> defines the problem more specifically as “the security, authenticity, and trust conflict between third-party oracles and the trustless execution of smart contracts’’. Therefore, the question we should ask in this context goes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>How can a network prove to be genuinely decentralised when a singular entity controls its one genuine connection to the real world?</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Because of that, oracles often become a single point of failure in many web3 projects. Solving the Oracle Problem is not possible without eliminating this issue. Another aspect of this problem lies within the design of the oracle ecosystem as the network must have a mechanism for resolving disputes. This is usually done by implementing a voting system between the nodes. Such systems however are vulnerable to bribes and collusion. We can safely assume that if in such a network, the potential reward of bribing nodes or colluding with them is greater than the cost, it <em>will</em> be used eventually. Therefore, even after making the system <em>genuinely decentralised</em> we still have to ensure its trustlessness. If the cost of frauding the ecosystem is always higher than the potential profit coming from doing so, we can call the network <em>cryptoeconomically secure</em>. In that case, to ensure this network is fraud-resistant, we do not need to assume the nodes are honest but that they simply are economically rational.</p>\n<p><strong>Areas to be covered<br>\n</strong>We can split solving the Oracle Problem into three major areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scalability</strong> — enabling oracles to process tens of thousands of transactions per minute without generating immense gas costs (The Data Latency vs Data Cost dilemma). The more frequently you need to fetch the data, the more you have to pay for it. In standard oracle solutions, the cost of fetching data at some point might even rise exponentially with increased latency. Proper scalability also means that the oracle is able to continue operation under extreme market conditions, such as the event known as Crypto Black Thursday.</li>\n<li><strong>Incentivisation </strong>— designing the right incentive structure to ensure cryptoeconomic security. This has been a major design flaw of the leading oracle solutions pointed out by the critics for a long time now. No protocol has managed to solve this problem yet.</li>\n<li><strong>Decentralisation </strong>— eliminating single points of failure. Ensuring that even if the malicious actors have access to the tech behind the oracle network (i.e. employees of the company) they still aren’t able to attack the network effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No oracle provider has managed to solve the problem yet. That is why exploring new approaches and pushing the needle for innovation is crucial for ensuring the long-term security of DeFi and blockchains in general. That is what we, the team behind RedStone, are highly committed to.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>At RedStone we are on a mission to build the next generation of Oracles. Our solution has an unrivaled ability to exert significant control over any new data listings. Result? The flexibility to follow any emerging market trends which, alongside significant cost savings, allows us to stay at the frontier of a new wave of Decentralised Finance.</p>\n<p><strong>Join us in the journey!</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"http://redstone.finance/discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discord</a> | <a href=\"https://redstone.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Github</a> | <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Linkedin</a></p>\n","id":6,"urlQuery":"the-oracle-problem-and-its-implications-for-blockchains"},{"class_article":"post-39 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-uncategorized layout-grid  ","link":"https://blog.redstone.finance/2022/06/27/prepare-for-warp-speed/","title":"Prepare for Warp speed","description":"Introducing Warp: a new implementation of data-driven smart contracts built on top of the Arweave network.

This has resulted in an impressive suite of utilities and apps in the Arweave ecosystem.</p>\n<p>And then there’s SmartWeave — Arweave’s own protocol, which goes way beyond storage.</p>\n<h3>Reasons to love SmartWeave</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Enables<a href=\"https://arweave.news/atomic-nfts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> real data ownership through NFTs</a>, providing data integrity</li>\n<li>Introduces<a href=\"https://academy.warp.cc/docs/pst/introduction/intro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> PST</a> (Profit Sharing Token) — <a href=\"https://arweave.medium.com/profit-sharing-tokens-a-new-incentivization-mechanism-for-an-open-web-1f2532411d6e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reliable tool for community incentivization</a></li>\n<li>Allows the transfer of assets within exchanges</li>\n<li>Decouples storage from computation and advances lazy evaluation, saving a ton on process efficiency</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ve started the journey with this stack while building the<a href=\"https://redstone.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> RedStone Oracle protocol</a> for on-chain data streams — the Arweave storage allows efficient persistence of large data volumes, and SmartWeave offers data integrity, which is crucial for our mission to power the DeFi with real-world data. Therefore, a smart-contract solution natively built on top of Arweave seemed to be a perfect match.</p>\n<p>We have had some issues with low performance, unclear base protocol definition and implementation that are all difficult to unit test. Additionally, there were chunks of duplicate code that made the protocol hard to maintain.</p>\n<p>We wanted to upgrade the developer experience not just for ourselves, but also for the entire SmartWeave community. That’s how Warp came to be.</p>\n<figure><img data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"810\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*95Ur9NPgWTuhFq1z\"></figure>\n<h3>Warp TL;DR</h3>\n<p>Warp is a major expansion of Arweave’s SmartWeave protocol.

RedStone uses affordable blockchain storage thanks to Arweave, which was designed to keep data in a cost-efficient manner. <strong>As of February 2022 storing 1GB would cost almost 50,000 times less on Arweave than on Ethereum.</strong> Low storage transaction costs allow RedStone to process more data with a higher update frequency.</p>\n<p>But the true innovation comes from the RedStone architecture. The majority of Oracles constantly store data on-chain and then deliver it to a dApp per request. Such design requires the form of a two-steps approach: First, a dApp’s contract submits a request for data to an Oracle Service and secondly this Oracle Service sends back a response with requested data. Unfortunately, with such a pattern, a contract cannot access data immediately, since it requires two separate transactions. Okay, but how RedStone approach this issue?</p>\n<p>We keep data off-chain in a decentralized public cache powered by our partners such as Streamr. When a transaction on Celo is triggered we stick price information to this transaction in a form of metadata with our <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-evm-connector/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EVM-Connector</a>, so there’s no need to request it from the blockchain. At the same time, we store that pricing data with the provider’s signature on Arweave to keep consistency.</p>\n<figure><img data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"839\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*y3QWQ5QcxeowR1am\"></figure>\n<p>Simplified RedStone (left) and common Oracle (right) architecture</p>\n<p>If you’d see missing data feeds for the Celo ecosystem or had questions about the integration you can reach out directly to the RedStone team on their Discord!</p>\n<p><strong>Celo channels</strong></p>\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CeloOrg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/CeloOrg</a></p>\n<p>Discord:<a href=\"https://discord.gg/SmAdkf75\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> https://discord.gg/SmAdkf75</a></p>\n<p><strong>RedStone channels:</strong></p>\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redstone_defi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/redstone_defi</a></p>\n<p>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46</a></p>\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/redstone-finance</a></p>\n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/redstone-finance/</a></p>\n","id":4,"urlQuery":"redstone-joins-the-celo-ecosystem-with-an-innovative-on-demand-data-fetching-architecture"},{"class_article":"post-33 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-partnership category-uncategorized layout-grid  ","link":"https://blog.redstone.finance/2022/02/02/cybertime-integrates-redstone-data-and-pseudo-random-number-generator/","title":"CyberTime integrates RedStone data and pseudo-random number generator","description":"CyberTime starts using RedStone’s pricing data feed for Celo and its pseudo-random number generator, in order to make distribution fair and robust on the leading… Read More »\nCyberTime integrates RedStone data and pseudo-random number generator","autor":"by RedStone","date":"February 2, 2022","image":"https://blog.redstone.finance/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1MA8_i4Oon23UONuE9FujnQ-2.png","content":"<figure><img data-width=\"4200\" data-height=\"2193\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MA8_i4Oon23UONuE9FujnQ.png\"></figure>\n<blockquote><p>CyberTime starts using RedStone’s pricing data feed for Celo and its pseudo-random number generator, in order to make distribution fair and robust on the leading NFT marketplace.</p></blockquote>\n<h4>RedStone provides customisable data feeds for the Celo ecosystem</h4>\n<p>RedStone creates a data ecosystem that focuses on long-tail and custom data related to areas such as NFT, carbon footprint, commodities prices and much more.

Some of them were trying to copy existing solutions, some caught the upward DeFi trend. But many were created to solve common industry problems. Both, our <a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oracles</a> and <a href=\"https://contracts.redstone.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contracts SDK</a>, have origins of the latter.</p>\n<blockquote><p>RedStone Oracles, with low-cost design, solve the problem of data feeds customisability, cross-chain interoperability and scalability limitations.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><em>RedStone Contracts offer Smart Contracts SDK optimised for data processing, solving problems of data heavy on-chain implementations like interactive NFTs.</em></p></blockquote>\n<h3>From hackathon needs to viable&nbsp;solution</h3>\n<p>Okay, so let’s start from the beginning. In 2019 and 2020 our team members participated multiple hackathons, facing a visible gap in the ecosystem: <strong>Oracles delivered just data about the most popular crypto assets and were expensive to start with.</strong></p>\n<p>Then, we came across <a href=\"https://www.arweave.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arweave</a>, a layer 1 chain optimised for data storage. To say it was a perfect match is not enough! Use case became obvious, therefore we joined the <a href=\"https://owf.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open Web Foundry</a> incubation program with the goal of creating a cost-efficient Oracle ecosystem with the ability to deliver data cross-chain.</p>\n<p>Q2 2021</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The inception of <a href=\"https://redstone.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RedStone cross-chain Oracle</a></li>\n<li>We’ve created the backbone of the ecosystem with <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-node\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">redstone-node</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">redstone-api</a> code</li>\n<li>Implementation of monitoring tools for RedStone Oracles and kicking off the first node for 100 tokens prices, already more than standard Oracles</li>\n<li>We closed our <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/redstone-raises-525k-first-round-080000352.html?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pre-Seed Funding</a> of $525,000 led by Maven 11</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-width=\"1961\" data-height=\"1566\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oAJe39MmS8yTzB-BEq4UOA.png\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Simplified overview of RedStone Oracle architecture</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>How did we end up building two products?</h3>\n<p>The development of Oracles was going faster than expected. We saw a huge interest in RedStone, which confirmed that a cross-chain Oracle solution with custom data feeds is needed by the DeFi &amp; Web3 developers. However, as we started using SmartWeave, native Smart Contracts for the Arweave network, we faced significant <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-smartcontracts/blob/main/docs/ROAD_MAP.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">performance and reliability issues.</a> To name a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low performance with unnecessary calls to Arweave HTTP API and lack of an easy way to add caching layer</li>\n<li>No clearly defined base protocol</li>\n<li>No unit and other types of tests, being very prone to error</li>\n<li>Code that is really hard to maintain and keep up to date with base implementation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That was the moment, when one of our core developers, Peter aka Ppe, decided to take matters into his own hands. Problems with original SmartWeave were faced by multiple projects in the ecosystem including Pianity, ArDrive and CommunityXYZ. Ppe knew that the need to optimise solutions to the possible extends is burning, so he created a structural plan of creating a dedicated RedStone Contracts SDK.</p>\n<blockquote><p>RedStone Contracts originated from SmartWeave but was rewritten from scratch, to make serious optimisation and fundamental changes possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once our Contracts SDK was ready for testing our team member, Alex, came up with a great educational use case, which got popular at that time — <a href=\"https://loot.redstone.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Loot Contract</a>.

Financial data feeds are the foundation for projects offering decentralised products like synthetics or insurance. However, the real potential of Web 3.0 is still constrained by the lack of more diverse data types. That’s where RedStone Oracles bring the change with its unique approach of storing non-standard data on Arweave and delivering it to all EVM-compatible chains.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>At their core, oracles are middleware that enables the communication between blockchains and off-chain systems such as data providers, cloud providers, IoT devices and payment systems.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Smart contracts on various blockchains, including Ethereum, can use data delivered by an oracle to make decisions whether to execute an agreement or command. Therefore, platforms and businesses utilising smart contracts rely directly on oracles for data feeds from the outside world. Examples of data collected might be the amount of rainfall in a certain area or the number of votes received by a political party.</p>\n<p>But centralised and third-party oracles are not in-line with the values of blockchain technology and decentralisation. The external data is not deterministic and fully synchronised, which makes it extremely difficult to reach a consensus between nodes. Moreover, the risk associated with directly accessing an insecure external environment is for many too big to take. Herein lies what is commonly referred to as <em>The Oracle Problem.</em></p>\n<h3>The Oracle&nbsp;Problem</h3>\n<p>Promising decentralisation, blockchain networks do not communicate with the outside world directly as they, by their very nature, have been designed to act independently of intermediary involvement in an isolated manner. Blockchains form a consensus to execute agreements or commands using data that is stored on their ledger, all of which is validated using nodes across distributed networks.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>The decentralised nature of blockchains prevents them from pulling in or pushing out data from or to any external system as a built-in functionality.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Blockchains nodes must be kept in isolated sandboxes and as such cannot directly access traditional services or generate data in-house. Without this data, they cannot execute such contracts as deciding the results for insurance policy payouts, determining financial settlements, knowing when to release or settle payments — in other words a specific blockchain is helpless in decisions that are dependent on data from outside of its own infrastructure. All nodes must also operate in the same, predictable, deterministic environment.</p>\n<h3>Early Attempts</h3>\n<p>During the early days of blockchain, there was a distinct lack of standards and market leaders. This “wild west” landscape saw almost every protocol creating its own proprietary oracle solution. However, building an oracle is not a trivial task, and home-made oracles turned out to be vulnerable which<a href=\"https://medium.com/meter-io/the-bzx-attacks-what-went-wrong-and-the-role-oracles-played-in-the-exploits-264619b9597d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> ended with many hacks</a>. Some of these hacks were far from low profile, with <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/seeming-oracle-attack-causes-100m-in-ethereum-defi-liquidations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">millions of dollars being stolen</a> or lost due to poor practice or human error.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Compound seems had an oracle attack via Coinbase Pro. Nearly $90M of liquidation. <a href=\"https://t.co/ptZsj3X8kf\">pic.twitter.com/ptZsj3X8kf</a></p>\n<p>— Marlboroxu (@marlboroxu) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marlboroxu/status/1331913142570369027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 26, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/43292/eminence-finance-exploit-leads-to-degen-soul-searching\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exploits continued</a>, protocol users started migrating towards professional solutions allowing market leaders to grow their shares.</p>\n<p>Another early attempt at finding a solution came in the form of a “two phase approach”:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A contract submits a request for data to an Oracle Service;</li>\n<li>An Oracle Service sends back a response with data.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This simple and flexible solution was pioneered by Oraclize (now <a href=\"http://www.oraclize.it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Provable</a>) and <a href=\"https://docs.chain.link/docs/architecture-request-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chainlink</a> as Basic Request Pattern, but the main disadvantage of this approach is that the contract cannot access data immediately as it requires two separate transactions; <strong>this kills usability as the client needs to wait until the data comes to a contract to see the result of an action.</strong></p>\n<p>A bigger problem, on top of that, is that fetching data is not atomic — meaning, not in a single transaction. As a result, an Oracle has to synchronise multiple contracts, which is complex, slow and ultimately kills interoperability.</p>\n<h3>Today’s State of&nbsp;Play</h3>\n<p>Currently, the most popular approach taken by blockchains in an attempt to address the aforementioned issues is to persist all data directly on-chain, so that the information is available in the context of a single transaction. Protocols have also formed syndicates around the most popular oracles using common standardised configuration.</p>\n<p>However, high maintenance costs of this approach mean that storing data directly on-chain is extremely expensive. <strong>On a historically busy day, with a daily average 500gwei Gas price, a single transaction may cost above $100, so if we persist every 10m across 30 sources, the daily bill will be more than $400k per one token.</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Ethereum in particular was never designed to be a storage network. As Oracles cannot “pause” feeding data, they have to just face transaction costs of a network they are based&nbsp;at.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Ethereum by its design, favours low-latency computation and heavily penalises any input/output operations such as storage. These costs force protocols to pull together the funding which means that they agree to use the same configuration and cannot tailor data to their needs. It is currently only possible to support a small number of tokens with such high operating costs, meaning less popular tokens are excluded from oracle support.</p>\n<p>Despite facing scalability and cost obstacles the Oracle Market Cap is valued at about $14 Billion as of January 2022 (according to Coingecko). With an expanding DeFi and crypto industry this number is only going to surge in the near future, so the need for diverse and reliable data will be growing.</p>\n<h3>Introducing RedStone</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RedStone</a> looks to mitigate the presented issues faced by blockchain projects by offering flexible and affordable oracle solutions. The ecosystem has changed dramatically over the last months and current DeFi protocols require more data delivered at lower latency; RedStone offers a radically different design of Oracles catering for the needs of modern Defi protocols.</p>\n<figure><img data-width=\"1500\" data-height=\"500\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gipbkA48N8f_zTs5PiLo1A.png\"></figure>\n<h4>1/ Affordable Storage</h4>\n<p>RedStone leverages a new generation of blockchain storage thanks to <a href=\"https://www.arweave.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arweave</a>, which was designed to keep large amounts of data at a fraction of the costs of chains like Ethereum. <strong>As of December 2021 storing 1GB on Arweave would cost $35, while on Ethereum: 1.7M$</strong>. Low operating costs allow us to process more data with a higher update frequency.</p>\n<h4>2/ On demand&nbsp;fetching</h4>\n<p>At RedStone innovation comes from our approach of delivering feeds to various chains. We do not simply upload information on blockchain every couple of minutes as the majority of Oracles do. Instead, our idea is to store data on Arweave, while a network of nodes and partners (such as <a href=\"https://medium.com/streamrblog/news-streamr-x-redstone-finance-power-the-next-generation-of-defi-oracles-80d84858fc67\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Streamr</a>) makes them available to DeFi projects — in a form of decentralised public cache.</p>\n<p>On top of that, <a href=\"https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-evm-connector\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EVM-Connector</a> enables to inject this data to the destination chain only when it’s needed. The signature ensuring integrity is attached to the transaction which requires this data, similar to metatransaction. The chart below shows simplified architecture of RedStone data ecosystem (left) and standard Oracle architecture for reference (right).</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-width=\"1404\" data-height=\"842\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*--uj0V0THxaldDsO3F__SA.png\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Comparison of simplified RedStone and standard Oracle architecture</figcaption></figure>\n<h4>3/ Flexible Data&nbsp;Streams</h4>\n<p>The capacity to process more data creates an opportunity for multiple data providers to enter the blockchain ecosystem. Each of them may apply different aggregation rules offering services tailored to the needs of DeFi protocols. A concrete example of this is that a lending pool requires time-averaged data not to liquidate users for a price flash-movement, however a synthetic dex or a margin-trading protocol will be interested to receive the most up to date information.</p>\n<blockquote><p>RedStone can source various types of data — we’re not limited to price data for assets&nbsp;only.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Currently, there are underserved areas in the Web3 space, such as data related to NFT, gaming, insurance, sports statistics, green bonds or even credit scoring. Our focus is to fill these niches with customisable and secure data feeds. RedStone can source various types of data — we’re not limited to price data for assets only. Technically, it is already possible to add other sources to our Oracles. First, we would like to review suggestions of use cases from developers and the community to decide what type of data would be the most useful and enable us to create innovative protocols. Once we see partners with requests for any specific type of data we’ll start working on an implementation. At the same time, becoming a data provider is simple and fully automated, as it is executed via <a href=\"https://contracts.redstone.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RedStone Contracts</a>. Hence, the whole process is transparent and truly decentralised.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-width=\"3024\" data-height=\"1376\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Rm9XWh_U6VzMPSnYeQK37g.png\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">RedStone delivers data feeds in 10 categories, including Stocks, ETFs and commodities</figcaption></figure>\n<h4>4/ Data Integrity</h4>\n<p>Allowing multiple data providers generates a need to curate them and select the most reliable ones, hence <strong>data providers need to stake RedStone tokens as collateral ensuring that they will keep operating and providing high quality data</strong>. RedStone also keeps a full record of the provider’s activity that will be permanently available on the Arweave chain so anyone could question a data feed and receive a part of that collateral in case the data is misrepresented.</p>\n<p>The logic that governs dispute resolution is powered by the ArGue protocol based on Schelling point consensus that will be described in detail in a separate post.</p>\n<h4>5/ Cross-Chain Oracle Solutions</h4>\n<p>RedStone’s data is cryptographically signed by providers and might be verified on any chain that supports <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S108480451830362X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">basic cryptographic primitives</a>. As a result, our logic abstracts storage from usage; <strong>although the data at RedStone is persisted on the Arweave chain, it could be used with any other blockchain.</strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to blockchains, our first choices are EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible chains like Ethereum, Celo, Polygon and Avalanche. As of December 2021, <a href=\"https://defillama.com/chains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>over 75% of the whole Total Value Locked (TVL)</strong></a> is based on EVM chains. Our team has invested a lot of resources into maximising the efficiency of data transmission, reaching a point where importing and verifying data could be cheaper than a single read from the EVM storage.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>In the future we plan to offer solutions across all major blockchains as part of our deliverables — becoming chain agnostic Oracles of the new generation.</em></p></blockquote>\n<h3>What Are We Doing&nbsp;Now?</h3>\n<p>RedStone already fetches data related to more than 1000 assets including crypto tokens, stocks, currencies and commodities. <a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can check out more on our WebApp</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/providers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data is served by providers</a> that aggregate the information from more than 50 external sources.
