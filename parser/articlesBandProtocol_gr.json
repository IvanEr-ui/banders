      "content": "\n                <p><strong>Every day that passes is closer to the relaunch for BandChain Phase 2 (Laozi), the first decentralized data economy for institutional-grade data providers and blockchain applications. We are proud to share the second article in our BandChain Phase 2 Whitepaper Digest series with our community which dives into how IBC will be implemented into Band Protocol and the network effects introduced into the system.</strong></p><p>Band Protocol is building a decentralized oracle network that caters for traditional enterprises to enter the blockchain application industry and Web 3 developers to access trusted, reliable information that is external to on-chain networks. With Phase 2, we unlock a new decentralized data market economy, unrestricted access for institutions to earn revenue from the provisioning of data, support IBC implementation, and Cosmos starport.</p><p>Our first article began with a deep dive into Band Protocol decentralized data market economy (Part 1: Scaling the supply side), we now focus on Part 2 — scaling the demand side of the BandChain decentralized oracle network.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*7yVLTvDMxDCBBdU7\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"52\"></figure><h3 id=\"scaling-band-protocol-integrations-through-ibc\"><strong>Scaling Band Protocol Integrations Through IBC</strong></h3><p>With BandChain built based on the Cosmos-SDK, we also allow interaction with our data oracle through Cosmos’ Inter-Blockchain-Communication protocol, IBC, which connects other compatible blockchain chains to request data from BandChain. This includes major blockchain networks such as Terra, Binance Chain, Injective Protocol, Secret Network and many others who will be able to seamlessly integrate and access Band Protocol oracles.</p><p>Oracle requests to BandChain can be made through IBC with a communication channel that is created between a destination chain and BandChain. This will require the setup of a pool account on BandChain that is used to pay data source fees and in most cases, owned by an entity or collective from another chain.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*NYVPGjgQ8rlZsfPF\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"792\"></figure><p>A counterparty chain may have a single request key for one pool account for all users, or a counterparty chain may secretly generate a unique request key for each of its users to ensure the same pool account will be deducted from usage by the same user.</p><h3 id=\"requesting-oracle-data-through-ibc\"><strong>Requesting Oracle Data Through IBC</strong></h3><p>Integrating Band Protocol oracles for Cosmos-SDK based networks will require a communication tunnel to be initialized with the oracle module on BandChain. Once the connection has been established, a pair of channel identifiers are generated — one for the counterparty chain and one for BandChain.</p><p>The channel identified is responsible for routing outgoing oracle request packers to the targeted oracle module on BandChain. The same identifier will be used to relay back the oracle response.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*StQj6ujC14oxxa3C\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1040\"></figure><p>With BandChain’s short blocktime of ~3seconds, a data request takes approximately 5 seconds from submitting the initial request until the request receives the final result. The IBC oracle request flow can be summarised in eight steps:</p><ol><li>Requesters create a request from the destination chain which is relayed to BandChain.</li><li>BandChain oracle modules fetches the corresponding oracle script and starts the preparation phase for returning information from all related data sources.</li><li>BandChain performs various checks such as the total fee for the request not exceeding the fee limit to ensure validity.</li><li>Acknowledgement is sent back to the destination chain which contains the request identifier created by BandChain or an error arising from the checks.</li><li>Assuming no errors, the request is then broadcasted and selected validators for the particular request will proceed to retrieve data from each of the data source.</li><li>With successful validator retrieval, the values are submitted back to BandChain.</li><li>If the number of validators successfully submitting the report is greater or equal to the minimum validator count specified, BandChain computes and stores a final value based on the aggregation logic specified in the oracle script.</li><li>The final result is also directly relayed back to the requesting chain and module in the form of a data packet.</li></ol><h3 id=\"ibc-request-payment-flow\"><strong>IBC Request Payment Flow</strong></h3><p>With a pool account set up, the payment flow for IBC requests is similar to that of a direct request. The additional layer is derived from the flow starting on a destination chain where the request is then relayed via a specific port and channel. Once BandChain receives the request, the payment flow is identical to the flow of a direct request with the exception that the account used for paying the fees is the pool account.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*ExhJ7dQkNipKUJs-\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1322\"></figure><h3 id=\"starport-integration\"><strong>Starport Integration</strong></h3><p>Cosmos’ Starport offers a development tool for Cosmos-SDK blockchains — providing a simple framework to scaffold a project with the ability to request oracle data from BandChain.

Smart contracts and blockchains are immutable in nature and deterministic, which means oracles such as Band Protocol play an imperative role in ensuring the correct inputs such as financial data are used in smart contract computation for the correct output.</p><p>With over <a href=\"https://defillama.com/?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">$115 Billion dollars</a> in total value locked, DeFi continues to be the industry vertical that propels blockchain technology towards mass adoption and oracles have never played a larger role in securing user funds from all over the globe.</p><p>Here are 12 different and unique use-cases in DeFi that have been enabled through Band Protocol’s decentralized, scalable and manipulation-resistant oracle technology.</p><hr><h3 id=\"money-markets-lending-borrowing\"><strong>Money Markets: Lending</strong></h3><p>Money markets consist of all projects which leverage smart contracts to bridge lenders with borrowers, most commonly for short-term loans with a length of one year or less. Lenders can supply their assets to earn yield from a fixed or variable interest rate compensated by borrowers on the other side.</p><p>To reliably operate in a decentralized and deterministic environment, such protocols require external market and financial information to evaluate the solvency based on supply and demand forces. Reliable and accurate price information ensures that loans originate at market prices based on the supplied collateral as well as triggering liquidation events in the event that a position becomes undercollateralized past a certain threshold (loan-to-value ratio).</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/bandprotocol/swipe-integrates-band-protocol-oracles-for-swipefi-launch-lists-band-on-visa-card-platform-3251268bb785?postPublishedType=repub&amp;ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Venus Protocol</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/cream-finance/c-r-e-a-m-enhances-price-oracles-adding-band-protocol-for-bsc-and-fantom-958d903bb0fa?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">CREAM Finance</a> are decentralized money market protocols that have integrated and rely on Band Protocol to secure billions of US Dollars in user deposits. Band Oracles source reliable price feeds for over 20  digital assets supported for borrowing and lending which are aggregated from up to 10 unique data providers composed of the leading data aggregators and exchanges to ensure real-time reflection of market price.</p><hr><h3 id=\"algorithmic-stablecoin\"><strong>Algorithmic Stablecoin</strong></h3><p>Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is tied to an external underlying asset such as foreign currencies or commodities. Most commonly tied to the US Dollar, stablecoins provide users a non-volatile medium to interact with different decentralized protocols or maintain market-neutral exposure. Centralized stablecoins such as USDC are usually backed by a regulated and established entity with fiat reserves, whereas algorithmic stablecoins rely on crypto-economics and over-collateralization to maintain pegs.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/bandprotocol/balanced-network-strategic-partnership-with-band-protocol-and-launch-review-1cfbde8adaef?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Balanced</a>, the first DeFi project to launch on ICON Network, is using Band Protocol to secure hundreds of millions of dollars in collateral used to mint bnUSD — a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. This is achieved through Band Oracles providing real-time and reliable price feeds for collateral assets (ICX initially and to be expanded in the future), to ensure that the Balanced Protocol is adequately collateralized.</p><hr><h3 id=\"futuresperpetuals\"><strong>Futures/Perpetuals</strong></h3><p>Perpetual futures, a form of the futures financial derivative without a specified delivery date, enables users to hold a long or short position without expiration. A cornerstone for advanced traders to leverage or hedge their positions, perpetual futures require price feeds to calculate the appropriate funding rate to pay lenders in the event of a leveraged position and trigger liquidation events if a particular position is insufficiently collateralized with enough margin.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/mcdex/mcdex-partners-with-band-protocol-to-secure-v3-launch-with-extensive-and-scalable-decentralized-9fec76c0085a?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">MCDEX</a> is a decentralized perpetual swap protocol using Band Protocol price feeds for their V3 launch on layer-2 scaling platform Arbitrum. Leveraging the highly scalable and flexibility provided by Band Oracles, MCDEX can utilize high-performance and real-time market data to safeguard the solvency of the protocol with the user experience of a centralized exchange.</p><hr><h3 id=\"synthetic-assets\"><strong>Synthetic Assets</strong></h3><p>Another form of financial derivative is a synthetic asset which provides exposure to an underlying asset such as digital assets from another network, traditional stocks, equities or commodities. This allows traders to gain price exposure to any asset that is not based on the blockchain or otherwise inaccessible due to a variety of reasons such as geographics, regulation and censorship.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/mirror-protocol/mirror-protocol-partners-with-band-protocol-to-secure-issuance-of-synthetic-stocks-and-etfs-1a12181b6cdc?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Mirror Protocol</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/linear-finance/linear-finance-partners-with-band-protocol-to-secure-synthetic-asset-creation-and-exchange-58b8458ade05?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Linear Finance</a> are leveraging Band Protocol price feeds to secure collateralization and minting mechanisms of different synthetic assets ranging from stocks, indices, commodities and digital currencies. Band Protocol is securing billions of dollars minted in synthetic assets across both platforms since launch and continues to add new assets as voted on through governance procedures.</p><hr><h3 id=\"financial-insurance\"><strong>Financial Insurance</strong></h3><p>Traditional insurance continues to be one of the lagging industries for innovation which requires manual overhead in assessing claims and often lacks transparency from policymakers. Decentralized insurance, particularly on-chain financial insurance protocols, requires a reliable source of information to submit one or more trigger events to a smart contract to enable instant settlement without interception from policymakers or policyholders. This is commonly referred to as parametric insurance.</p><p><a href=\"https://polkacover.medium.com/polkacover-partners-up-with-band-protocol-to-deliver-global-crypto-and-insurance-35d2af9148b8?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Polkacover</a> has teamed up with Band Protocol to bring insurance products to DeFi and crypto exchanges which aren’t widely available today. Insurance providers on the Polkacover network will work with Band Protocol to leverage the end-to-end flexibility and customizability offered to plug in their internal endpoints/APIs to track trigger events.</p><hr><h3 id=\"asset-management\"><strong>Asset Management</strong></h3><p>Automated asset management for interacting with DeFi protocols or managing a basket of assets for price exposure can be enabled through smart contracts. This provides users the benefits of low maintenance, reduced overhead in transaction fees or the automated execution of a predetermined strategy.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/bandprotocol/alpha-finance-integrates-decentralized-price-oracles-from-band-protocol-through-alpha-oracle-5ac7ccad8a71?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Alpha Finance</a> is the leading provider of leveraged yield farming products which has integrated Band Protocol oracles to secure over $1.5 billion in total value locked and ensure the solvency of the protocol. Band Oracles play a critical role in ensuring the built-in lending market within Alpha Homora utilizes real-time price feeds for a dozen different digital assets.</p><hr><h3 id=\"financial-prediction-markets\"><strong>Financial Prediction Markets</strong></h3><p>Prediction markets are exchange-traded markets that bet on the occurrences of a particular event by a predetermined date. Most commonly, for financial prediction markets, a marketplace is provided to speculate or bet on an underlying asset — normally whether it will lower or higher than a predetermined amount by a particular date in the future.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/futureicx-band-protocol-partnership-the-seers-and-the-oracles-a9eba61e7708?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">EpicX</a> is a financial prediction market relying on Band Protocol oracles to settle markets for digital assets at different time intervals such as 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour etc. Band Oracles provide a reliable source of aggregated price data from the most liquid exchanges and data aggregators to accurately settle financial prediction markets while mitigating the probability of disputes.</p><hr><h3 id=\"proof-of-custody-oracles\"><strong>Proof-of-Custody Oracles</strong></h3><p>Interacting with cross-chain DeFi applications commonly requires tokens to be bridged — locked up in a smart contract on one network and minting a ‘wrapped’ version on another. These tokens are representative of an underlying asset or position as a liquidity provider or borrower/lender. Proof-of-Custody oracles from Band Protocol reads data from the blockchain state to keep track of different minting and burning mechanisms to instantly detect discrepancies whether through an exploit or malicious actions.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/graviton-one/graviton-collaborates-with-band-protocol-to-increase-reliability-of-oracle-sub-systems-fc3aab2821d3?source=social.tw\">Graviton</a> is a cross-chain liquidity protocol using Band Protocol Proof-of-Custody oracles to provide users and internal monitoring mechanisms insight into real-time cross-chain events and price feeds. This brings unparalleled transparency and information for users and teams to verify, not trusting any standalone entity or smart contract to operate as intended.</p><hr><h3 id=\"decentralized-exchanges\"><strong>Decentralized Exchanges</strong></h3><p>When interacting with centralized exchanges, users are able to act on the reliable and accurate price information for different assets to create informed decisions. Band Protocol brings the experience of using a centralized exchange to decentralized exchanges through a collection of over 230  reference price feeds that are integration-ready on any front-end application.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/krystaldefi/krystal-is-live-one-platform-all-defi-5afa468016c9?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Krystal</a> uses Band Protocol to provide users with reliable data to create highly informed decisions without manually referring to external sources of information or manual verification. This will be expanded to support new asset additions, custom token lists and future products with speed to market.</p><hr><h3 id=\"decentralized-asset-bridges\"><strong>Decentralized Asset Bridges</strong></h3><p>With a rapidly increasing amount of blockchain networks and platforms in production, trustless token bridges have become critical in ensuring efficient capital flow and user experience. Creating a trustless representation of any asset requires a sufficient amount of collateral or composite of the underlying asset — oracles bring safeguards and security measures to asset bridges through price feeds which are integrated within smart contract logic to evaluate solvency.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/interlay/interlay-integrates-band-protocol-to-power-bitcoin-on-polkadot-e4156a3433f?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Interlay</a>, the team building Polkadot’s trustless Bitcoin bridge, is using Band Protocol to secure the cross-chain asset bridge and determine fees paid out to bridge maintainers. With Band Oracles which are blockchain-agnostic, this can be achieved without risk of network congestion or high transaction fees.</p><hr><h3 id=\"options\"><strong>Options</strong></h3><p>Another financial derivative is an options contract which gives holders the right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset before an expiration date in the future. Trustless and decentralized options require two main types of data feeds — price data and implied volatility to reliably calculate the option premium</p><p>Band Protocol can be used to connect to external endpoints and APIs from reputable sources for implied volatility such as ByBit and Deribit as well as major data aggregators and exchanges for price feeds.</p><hr><h3 id=\"programmable-conditional-transactions\"><strong>Programmable</strong></h3><p>An additional benefit of deterministic execution in smart contracts is the ability to program conditions based on a variety of inputs to execute a future transaction. When considering smart devices and IoT, where data can be fed directly into a custom oracle script on BandChain — the possibilities can be endless.</p><p>Take the supply chain industry, for instance, it is still limited by the manual paperwork and human verification points at locations. Smart contracts powered by a custom Band Oracle connected to shipping location APIs can trigger the automatic release of capital to suppliers from retailers.</p><p>This would reduce the necessity for manual payments, paperwork and verifications to create a more streamlined and efficient supply chain system.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*dC6k2JAl1x4uMiyc\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"52\"></figure><h3 id=\"final-remarks\"><strong>Final Remarks</strong></h3><p>As Band Protocol grows, we continue to see the flexible oracle framework on BandChain unlock virtually any data on the open internet for decentralized applications and become leveraged in different ways never thought possible before. With theoretically infinite use-cases of how smart contracts can use Band Protocol, we are excited to work with the next generation of builders and continue innovating the decentralized oracle network for developers.</p><p>Are you looking to build a blockchain or DeFi application?

During this year, the Band Protocol team has solved many technical and business problems to deliver unique solutions such as BandChain Phase 2 and IBC Oracle service. All the while keeping our focus on improving internal processes to confidently embark into new ecosystems both Layer 1s and Layer 2s that present a heightened demand for oracle integration.</p><p>With tremendous excitement, we are proud to recap 2021, share our 2022 roadmap and our vision for the future beyond oracle.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*N7c8LPWQXozVjdZY\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"66\"></figure><h3 id=\"2021-recap-%E2%80%94-rapid-expansion\">2021 Recap — Rapid Expansion</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*IibKvQ8BvgjI61Qq\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1016\"></figure><p>With the priority to serve the DeFi market, our main goals for the year were to grow the usage of BandChain, and introduce BandChain Phase 2 to enable a more scalable infrastructure for both the data providers side and user side. With these missions in mind, we have improved monitoring processes and deployment operations that have helped us to hold a strong position in the oracle competitive landscape.</p><p>The current BandChain has served as a reliable platform for data solutions as expected. We saw a growth in the number of requests over the past year, with the current request number at over 16.1 million requests when accounting for both Phase 1 and Phase 2.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*MIpetkcdqylex_DR\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1172\" height=\"858\"></figure><p>We have also acquired many power users in different ecosystems. As of date, we have a total number of 22 official integrations, of which 17 are on mainnets and 5 on testnets. Our integration spans across 12 ecosystems including the nascent ones such as Avalanche, Celo Network, Oasis Network, Optimism and more — thanks to our highly scalable infrastructure and procedure which allows us to be the first live oracle on many of these platforms and claim the first-mover advantage.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*F02FUB7zYk_bMbJ2\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"991\"></figure><p>With the integration acquisition, BandChain has seen up to $16.73 Billion in Total Value Secured (TVS) during the peak of market activity in 2021. Our integration include (but not limited to) Mirror Protocol (Terra Ecosystem), Alpha Finance Labs (Ethereum, Avalanche, BSC), C.R.E.A.M. Finance, and more.</p><p>On the data provider side, we have secured over 70 numbers of data sources, supplying over 5 different types of data to our users with categories ranging from stock, index, foreign currency, commodities, to cryptocurrency asset prices.</p><p><strong>Extending the Oracle Service Reach</strong></p><p>After the launch of BandChain Phase 2, the Band Protocol team submitted proposals to enable IBC-token transfer and IBC-oracle. With the help of the Tendermint (now Ignite) team to include our IBC-oracle module with <a href=\"https://medium.com/paradigm-fund/c%C3%B8smos-network-starport-v0-17-4871f285c1c8?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Starport</a>, these IBC features have allowed us to realize our goals of becoming more cross-chain compatible and increasing data distribution channels.</p><p>We <a href=\"https://blog.injectiveprotocol.com/injective-is-set-to-launch-the-worlds-first-fully-decentralized-derivatives-markets-with-the-band-ibc-oracle/?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">successfully launched this feature with Injective Protocol</a> who requests data through IBC Oracle and pays for requests with Band token. Combined with the already growing traffic from our aggressive integration with new protocols, this IBC strategy brought us even more volume that filled up to 80% of block capacity during peak period — displaying a strong sign of growth and demand for usage. This compels us to work heavily on expanding our service capacity.</p><p><strong>Expanding Capacity</strong></p><p>Chain Capacity: <br>To address the increase in requests and block traffic, the Band Protocol team has taken the following measures:</p><ol><li>Introduced dynamic gas in Phase 2 which improve gas utilization when requesting more computational-heavy requests (eg. many sources and asset feeds)</li><li>Proposed to reduce gas parameter which increases block capacity by approximately 25%</li></ol><p>Integration Capacity:<br>Moreover, the team has worked in improving many internal toolings such as monitoring dashboard, operating procedures to add support for new feeds and data sources to ensure the speed of our integration. This has allowed us to be the first to launch on new Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks such as <a href=\"https://medium.com/celoorg/band-oracle-services-now-available-on-celo-7e8a6bddb9a8?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Celo Network</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/band-protocol-live-on-oasis-network-mainnet-f4ce6b621118?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Oasis Network</a>, Godwoken (Testnet) and more.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*cvBGZWyX-PMUz8wX\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"66\"></figure><h3 id=\"our-vision\">Our Vision</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*E9hTZMDiaeHYb6a4feOJfQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2563\" height=\"1386\"></figure><h4 id=\"bandchain-phase-2-laozi\"><strong>BandChain Phase 2 Laozi</strong></h4><p>As we continue to iterate on BandChain, our flagship product with a proven product-market fit, we will be launching auxiliary services to enhance its usage.

One main design goal is to reduce the reliance on data settlement (Oracle Script and Data Source script) on Bandchain which requires domain-specific knowledge to deploy. This corresponds to our mission of making Band Oracle easier to adopt in a self-serving manner, serving data to all. We will be showing you the design and development of Band Oracle v3 in the upcoming quarters.</p><h3 id=\"beyond-oracle-the-expanded-vision-over-the-next-3%E2%80%935-years\">Beyond Oracle: The Expanded Vision Over the Next 3–5 Years</h3><p>Throughout the years of working with multiple blockchain projects and providing an oracle solution that secures $10B  in value on-chain, we have been privileged to be working with some of the most incredible builders in the blockchain space. Along the way we have learned how they shipped some of the most high-quality products and optimizations to their users, as well as the obstacles they face in the process.</p><p>Such insights have inspired the team to think more deeply into blockchain technology beyond oracle, especially from the developer’s perspectives and how we, as an infrastructure builder, can contribute to better security and scalability for the industry as a whole.</p><p>Staying true to our initial vision centered around providing reliable data to the open internet has served us on a journey thus far. The Band Protocol team’s vision has now grown into advancing the growth of web3 through high-quality infrastructure, leveraging our oracle product as our stepping stone.</p><h4 id=\"bandbuilderverse-bbv\"><strong>BandBuilderVerse (BBV)</strong></h4><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*vL3_NNPyvfKqNZplojGNvA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2563\" height=\"1336\"></figure><p>The Band Protocol team will take on the next mission of building a universe of high-quality development tools for Web3 builders to serve our developer community. In the next 3–5 years after mastering the oracle business as the first stepping stone, we will work to expand our line of products to a more complete suite of development toolkit blockchain developers can rely on and leverage to thrive in web3.</p><p>The details of the strategy on product launches will be subjected to the future’s web3 demand and industry landscape. As of now, the suite of products that we have identified potentially includes:</p><ol><li>Band L2 Scalability Solution</li><li>Band Asset Bridge</li><li>Band Data Indexer</li><li>Band DApp Operation</li><li>Band Training</li></ol><p>This is a challenging mission that the band protocol team is poised to take on. Leveraging our resource of highly technical teams and web3 infrastructure-focused knowledge from building in web3 space since 2017, we are one of the most equipped teams in the space to take on infrastructure problems.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*wd3EHRRKjfxDINC0\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"66\"></figure><p><strong>Closing Remarks</strong></p><p>We have been on a trajectory of growth but our journey has barely begun! Stay tuned to see Band Protocol continue to capture more adoption, expand to different ecosystems with the BandChain Phase 2 products in the pipeline. But better yet, stick around to see how we continue to grow to accomplish a bigger vision to contribute to the web3 community and bring value back to the Band community.</p><p>2022 is set to a high tone with renewed vision and knowledge.

Previously known as Clover Finance, CLV has partnered with Band Protocol to bring secure and accurate data feeds to its infrastructure platform for cross-chain and decentralized applications. With interoperability and cross-chain in mind, CLV products offer great connectivity within the growing crypto space.</p><p>Different blockchain networks currently remain isolated in silos that cannot trustlessly communicate with each other. The isolation between different ecosystems has been a major barrier to mass adoption. This has resulted in many centralized third-party custodial services to come up with solutions to exchange financial assets in an efficient manner. However, these centralized solutions defeat the core blockchain concept of decentralization, transparency, and immutability.</p><p>CLV aims to solve the current challenge of trustless communication by creating a new level of interoperability by using its built-in SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) chain simulation technology. This technology enables seamless cross-chain communication and trustless two-ways pegs between two separate chains such as Ethereum and Polkadot.</p><p>As a cross-chain compatible decentralized oracle that enables interoperability between smart contracts and the traditional web, Band Protocol’s integration with CLV will help to enhance and extend smart contract capabilities for developers on the CLV ecosystem. Presently, lenders on CLV are using oracle feeds provided by Band Protocol.</p><p>Through this integration, current and future CLV developers can leverage Band Protocol oracles to connect to external data providers in a reliable, accurate and decentralized manner.</p><p>The Band Standard Dataset currently includes a collection of over 80  qualified data feeds from a growing number of data sources.

CLV launched its mainnet in July 2021 with the support from various different partnerships and investments which include Polychain, Divergence Ventures, Alameda Research, Huobi, OKex’s Ventures Arm as well as others. CLV won Polkadot’s fifth parachain slot auction in December 2021. The project seeks to provide an intuitive blockchain infrastructure to reduce the effort and cost for DeFi developers.</p><p>Built as a blockchain operating system, CLV has a layer 1 blockchain, a smart contract platform, a multi-chain DeFi hub, and a cross-chain wallet. The protocol structure essentially has 4 different layers which include the storage layer, the smart contracts layer, the DeFi protocol layer, and the eApps layer.</p><p>The CLV Chain features a unique built-in SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) Chain Simulation Technology, a mechanism that operates as a two-way peg system between blockchains. This allows the transfer of an asset from a base chain to a secondary blockchain and vice versa, enabling seamless cross-chain communication between networks. Instead of sending tokens from one chain to another, tokens are temporarily locked on the base chain while the equivalent amount of tokens is unlocked on the receiving chain.</p><p>Additionally, CLV offers a multi-chain wallet called the CLV Wallet, a non-custodial wallet that is multi-chain and multi-platform that helps users to manage crypto assets and interact with all types of dApps. This all-in-one wallet is designed for everyday use, including for DeFi, metaverse, and gaming purposes.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/0-bplseht4crks92jx.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w600/max/800/0-bplseht4crks92jx.png 600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/0-bplseht4crks92jx.png 640w\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1450\" height=\"148\" srcset=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w600/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png 600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w1000/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png 1000w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png 1450w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><strong><em>About Band Protocol</em></strong></p><p>Band Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform with the aspiration to build high-quality suites of web3 development products.

Apart from supporting EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), Astar also supports Web Assembly (WASM) and future layer 2 blockchain scaling solutions so the network has a solid infrastructure for future demands from Web3.0 developers.</em></p><p><em>Shiden Network is a “Canarian network” or “test network” for Astar. Similar to Astar Network, Shiden Network is a multi-chain smart contract platform that operates on the Kusama hub. Shiden also supports WASM and layer 2 blockchain scaling solutions. Even though the two networks are practically the same project with the same motivations, the development cycle is faster on Shiden as it is a test network.</em></p><p><em>Astar has a unique DApps reward or staking mechanism for both developers and investors. For investors, similar to PoS Staking, DApp staking allows DApp stakers (also known as nominators) to submit their Astar tokens to DApps they want to support and the rewards are split between stakers and developers. Developers are incentivized to deploy applications onto the network as they can earn rewards when the network is used and new blocks are generated. This mechanism aligns the interest of both investors and developers to increase the utility of the ecosystem by having more useful applications. This creates a positive networking effect that can help both the Astar Network and Shiden Network to grow simultaneously and increase the network’s intrinsic value.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/0-6c3ykedyfc5wsvzn.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w600/max/800/0-6c3ykedyfc5wsvzn.png 600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w1000/max/800/0-6c3ykedyfc5wsvzn.png 1000w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/0-6c3ykedyfc5wsvzn.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1450\" height=\"148\" srcset=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w600/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png 600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w1000/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png 1000w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png 1450w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><strong><em>About Band Protocol</em></strong></p><p><em>Band Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform with the aspiration to build high-quality suites of web3 development products.

The globally renowned BitTorrent is an EVM cross-chain protocol designed with a PoS (Proof-of-stake) mechanism and leverages sidechains for the scaling of smart contracts on the Ethereum, TRON, and BNB Chains.</p><p>BTTC officially launched its mainnet in December 2021. Products in phase 1 support the wallet, the cross-chain bridge, the explorer, and the staking function. Later phases of BTTC’s roadmap revolve around bringing in more dAap developers to build and grow BTTC’s ecosystem, and extending its inter-connectivity to more blockchain networks in order to realize the goal of connecting all chains.</p><p>BTTC’s integration with Band Protocol will enable BTTC to onboard many smart contract developers to start developing protocols ranging from DeFi and lending to gaming applications. The chain’s compatibility with Ethereum-based smart contracts combined with a growing list of additional functions since the integration with the TRON network has allowed developers to easily migrate from other chains to the BTTC chain. As one of the leading blockchain network in the fields of DeFi and lending, NFT, decentralized storage, as well as others, TRON network can utilize BTTC’s cross-chain interoperability and scalability to help it excel as the new hub of blockchain interconnectivity.</p><p>BTT, BTTC’s native token, has allowed the creation of a token-based economy for networking, bandwidth, and storage resources on the BitTorrent network, therefore enabling network participants to capture the value of sharing bandwidth and storage. As BTTC develops further from this point with more dApps joining the ecosystem, the ecosystem will likely produce even more innovative use cases that can integrate the growing P2P platform market into the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>The Band Standard Dataset currently includes a collection of over 80  qualified data feeds from a growing number of data sources.

Band Protocol is committed to help enhance the capabilities and use cases on smart contract platforms as we continuously strive to provide our clients with reliable data under a decentralised oracle framework. This integration will bring further integrations with various dApp developers who are working under the Meter ecosystem.</p><p>Meter is a high-performance layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain infrastructure that scales and connects the financial internet in a multi-chain future. The protocol separates its built-in, crypto-native, metastable DeFi infrastructure to its governance infrastructure that uses the HotStuff based proof of stake consensus with MTRG (Meter Governance Token) to manage the blockchain ledger.</p><p>Meter’s unique decentralised financial infrastructure is achieved through the combination of both a Proof-of-Work (PoW), via its stablecoin (MTR), and a proof of stake (PoS) governance, via its MTRG token. This hybrid PoW/PoS consensus that Meter describes as the Proof-of-Value (PoV) consensus, helps to alleviate the disadvantages of having a single consensus mechanism. This infrastructure clearly separates the consensus layer for bookkeeping and currency issuance. The consensus of PoW is responsible for the issuance of currency through mining whilst the PoS consensus uses the HotStuff consensus protocol, a variant of the Byazantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol, which allows the network to perform bookkeeping quickly.</p><p>Meter offers another unique feature in the stablecoin MTR, generated by PoW mining, because it is directly linked to the cost incurred for the miners on the network. The Meter system achieves this by primarily including the cost of electricity, the major cost for miners to validate the network, to anchor the mining cost of the MTR stablecoin to the power consumption of mining one MTR. This mechanism efficiently monetizes the economic behaviour of miners seeking profit and stabilises the market price of MTR as it reflects the continuously adjusting supply and demand relationship for the network.</p><p>Band Protocol is looking forward to collaborating with the many developers working under the Meter network. In order to enhance the developer’s experience, we also provide customization that is tailored to each project’s specific need.

      "content": "\n                <p>Randomness is a fundamental function that helps to operate many modern decentralized applications (dApps). However, the root and foundation of this vital randomness mechanism is often neglected. DApps often rely on “good” randomness that must be newly generated and independent of the state of the application. Essentially, random results should have integrity and must be verifiable, tamper-proof, and unpredictable.</p><p>For example, consider an online lottery system where participants place their bids, wait for the random result, and winnings are allocated according to the participant’s bid placements. Similarly, consider leadership elections (often used in committee-based blockchain platforms) that proceed in rounds to randomly elect a leader among the participants. With such applications or use-cases, it is crucial to guarantee that randomness is sampled uniformly and independently of the application’s state, therefore making it hard to predict as well as ensuring that there are no malicious actors who can affect the outcome of such lottery winnings and leadership elections.</p><hr><h3 id=\"verifiable-random-function-vrf-\">Verifiable Random Function (VRF)</h3><p>Applications that require “good” random values to be produced commonly rely on cryptography techniques to deliver pseudorandom values which are essentially values that are impossible to distinguish from uniformly randomized values. A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is a mathematical operation that processes inputted values and generates a pseudorandom output along with the proof of authenticity of the output generation process. Challengers that question the random process can verify the proof to ensure that pseudorandom results are truly valid.</p><p>In general, the core of the VRF system will have a set of secret keys used to generate verifiable results and a set of corresponding public keys used to verify the results produced. For example, a secret key is generated in private, and a cryptographic function maps the seed to an output value along with its proof. The crucial property is that someone that does not have access to the secret key cannot distinguish, in polynomial time, the output from a value that is sampled uniformly at random from the range of all possible outcomes.</p><hr><h3 id=\"bandchain-s-vrf-security-properties\"><strong>BandChain’s VRF Security Properties</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Unpredictability</strong>: This ensures that the computed outputs are distributed in a way that is, for all practical purposes, uniformly random. This is a fundamental property for VRF as it conveys that the VRF behaves in the same manner as a random oracle. In practice, this means that anyone without the secret key has no way of predicting the outcome in a manner that is better than “randomly guessing”, even when the seed is known.</li><li><strong>Uniqueness</strong>: This ensures that after the VRF providers publish their secret key, the providers can only produce proof that helps to verify the authenticity of the VRF output value for every seed. In other words, for a given secret key and seed, it is incredibly difficult to find two different VRF values that both pass the verification. This property is crucial to protecting against malicious actors that try to claim a specific output that is generated in a manner that violates the intended purpose and objective.</li><li><strong>Collision-Resistance</strong>: This ensures that it is computationally difficult to find two different inputs such as “seed1” and “seed2”, that have the same secret key to obtain the identical output value — similar to the classic property of the cryptographic hash function. The difference for VRFs is that the property remains to be true even against an adversary that knows the secret key. This offers a different type of protection than that from its unique property. For example, it protects against a party that tries to claim an output that is computed from, say input “seed1” as if it was computed from a different, say input “seed2”.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"what-is-bandchain-s-vrf\">What is BandChain’s VRF?</h3><p>Our solution for verifiable pseudorandomness is based on the BandChain blockchain. Our protocol uses a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to cryptographically secure and verify that produced results have not been tampered with.</p><p><a href=\"https://bandprotocol.com/vrf?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">BandChain Verifiable Randomness</a> extends the general form of the VRF system to serve requests from dApps, based on the distributed BandChain Oracle Network. BandChain is a public blockchain that provides APIs for data and services that are stored “off-chain” on the traditional web or from third-party providers. It supports generic data requests from other public blockchains and performs on-chain aggregation according to the BandChain Oracle Scripts. The aggregation process works like a smart contract on the EVM platform as the process is executed on-chain and an oracle result is produced. The oracle results are also stored on the BandChain.</p><p>After that, the results will be sent to the calling dApp on the main blockchain (typically Ethereum or other EVMs), along with a proof of authenticity via customized one-way bridges or via Inter-blockchain Communication Protocol. To guarantee verifiable “good” randomness that is suitable for security-critical applications, we deploy the cryptographic primitive of Verifiable Random Functions. Band’s VRF provides values that are indistinguishable from uniformly random generated values, with the added benefit of having a verified proof of authenticity that concerns the pre-published public key.</p><hr><h4 id=\"protocol-flow\"><strong>Protocol Flow</strong></h4><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/0-8llkyylspjtjs0p2.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"“How does Band VRF work?” Flow\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"812\" srcset=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w600/max/800/0-8llkyylspjtjs0p2.jpg 600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w1000/max/800/0-8llkyylspjtjs0p2.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/0-8llkyylspjtjs0p2.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>“How does Band VRF work?”</figcaption></figure><p>At a high level, our protocol works as follows.</p><ul><li>First, two contracts, the <strong>VRF contract</strong> and the <strong>Bridge contract</strong>, are deployed on the main chain (Ethereum or other EVMs). The first contract is responsible for receiving randomness requests from dApps and it contains code that pre-processes the request to be ready for submission to the Band side-chain. It also works as the receiving end of the request’s result. The second contract, as the name denotes, works as the connecting “bridge” between the two chains to validate the latest state of the side chain and verify that the received results from VRF requests are indeed the ones computed and stored on the BandChain.</li><li>A third-party dApp that wishes to request a random value, submits its request to the <strong>VRF contract</strong>, which then prepares the actual VRF input by expanding it into a VRF seed. This is then picked up by incentivized actors and/or the Band Foundation and is submitted as a VRF request to the <strong>BandChain</strong>.</li><li>In particular, a <strong>VRF Oracle Script</strong> collects this request and then maps it to the set of <strong>VRF data sources</strong> that are available to the chain, as well as a number of <strong>BandChain validators</strong>. The Oracle Script then randomly assigns the request to a<strong> VRF provider</strong> that corresponds to one of the VRF data sources. The assigned provider evaluates the VRF based on the prescribed input using its VRF secret key and then broadcasts the result to the <strong>Band Network</strong>.</li><li>After that, all chosen validators run the VRF verification algorithm using the assigned provider’s public key and if the verification is successful, the result will be transmitted to the VRF Oracle Script. After collecting the necessary number of results from the validators, the Oracle Script will accept the majority as the final result which then becomes part of the BandChain state.</li><li>The final result, which will be included in next block’s computation, is sent back to the main chain’s VRF contract with a Merkle tree proof for its inclusion on the BandChain’s state. Finally, this proof is verified with the Bridge contract and after a successful check, is sent to the original dApp.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>To learn more about Band’s VRF, visit these official channels:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>VRF Landing Page</strong>: <a href=\"https://bandprotocol.com/vrf?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bandprotocol.com/vrf</a></li><li><strong>VRF Whitepaper</strong>: <a href=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/files/static/band-vrf-whitepaper.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">/content/files/static/band-vrf-whitepaper.pdf</a></li><li><strong>Example Use-Cases</strong>: <a href=\"https://docs.bandchain.org/vrf/example.html?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://docs.bandchain.org/vrf/example.html</a></li><li><strong>How does Band VRF works?</strong>: <a href=\"https://docs.bandchain.org/vrf/introduction.html?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://docs.bandchain.org/vrf/introduction.html</a></li></ul><p><strong>Follow </strong><a href=\"https://bandprotocol.com/?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Band Protocol</strong></a><strong> to stay up to date on our latest updates:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bandprotocol?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://t.me/bandprotocol?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Telegram</a> | <a href=\"https://medium.com/bandprotocol?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Medium</a> | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs2e4bvq5VC3TzoI429Sepg?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Youtube</a> |<a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/694023152795385948/700716980222689411?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\"> Discord </a>| <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bandprotocol?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Reddit</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/bandprotocol/?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Github</a></p>\n            ",

This significant latest upgrade to our chain will impose fundamental changes to multiple things — one of which is how gas is calculated on the BandChain. This results in an improved user experience as well as throughput time on our network. Before going through the details of this latest upgrade, let us provide you with a brief recap of the current version.</p><p>In our previous version, Owasm (Oracle WebAssembly) utilized the ‘inject gas’ technique to calculate the amount of gas that would be used to run a Wasm script. An Oracle Script (OS) leverages this technique that inputs a gas consumption function into the Wasm code; there was no inherent mechanism that can be used to calculate gas innately in the OS itself.</p><p>Although secure, this workaround technique in our previous version meant that the BandChain was operating less efficiently than it could be. This is due to the fact that the gas consumption function, injected into the Wasm OS code, would in turn call the gas function on the host environment which could, in an anomalous case, lead to delays. Therefore, to handle these anomaly cases, we have had to lower our gas limit and gas multiplier. <strong>This</strong> <strong>was holding us back from reaching our full potential</strong>.</p><hr><h3 id=\"chain-2-4-version-upgrade-achievements\"><strong>Chain 2.4 Version Upgrade Achievements</strong></h3><p>With this upgrade, we use the new <strong>Metering Middleware</strong> from Wasmer, a fast and secure WebAssembly runtime, to calculate gas consumption instead of using the ‘inject gas’ technique. This transition allows the OS to efficiently calculate gas consumption in a manner that is not only more methodical, but also structurally more sound. There are 4 major advantages in doing this:</p><ol><li>More streamlined code interaction as the Middleware is on the same level as Owasm code</li><li>Total elimination of any risk to modifications of the Wasm code</li><li>Customizable Metering Middleware that allows for a more flexible gas consumption calculation</li><li>Ultimately a much faster network</li></ol><p>In addition, as we fine-tuned the Metering Middleware, we are able to achieve a reliable formula whereby we can accurately calculate the execution time based on gas calculated. This is also applicable to all instructions on the BandChain as well as those imported from the host environment.<strong> Above all, these improvements on the key elements of the BandChain has led to a much faster network.</strong></p><hr><h3 id=\"increased-throughput-by-at-least-10x\"><strong>Increased Throughput by at least 10X</strong></h3><p>This improved efficiency also comes from minimizing the required gas as we are able to decrease the required work range threshold when calculating the required gas for a particular work. The graph below illustrates this massive achievement.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/0-2xedvhdgna3aich8.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1424\" height=\"884\" srcset=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w600/max/800/0-2xedvhdgna3aich8.png 600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w1000/max/800/0-2xedvhdgna3aich8.png 1000w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/0-2xedvhdgna3aich8.png 1424w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>To put this into perspective, we are able to reduce the time taken to run the same task from the worst case scenario of 0.4 seconds to 0.03 seconds. <strong>The new optimal throughput is over 10X of the previous version and equates to a throughput speed that is 2–3 times faster than the industry average for upgrades.</strong></p><hr><h3 id=\"increased-request-throughput-by-increasing-block-gas-limit\"><strong>Increased Request Throughput by Increasing Block Gas Limit</strong></h3><p>In our recent benchmark experiment, it was shown that an average Cosmos module use-case consumes 50 million Cosmos SDK gas per second. As such, we set the BandChain parameters to match this i.e. BandChain block gas limit has been increased by 6.25 times from 8Mn (limited by the aforementioned infinite loop scenario) to 50Mn. Given that our blocktime is 3 seconds, split into 1.5 seconds for consensus time between nodes and 1 second for transaction execution time, we are able to achieve a safety cushion of 0.5 seconds spare. All of this is crucial as it ensures the timely delivery and execution of data (no longer than the 3 seconds block time), and faster than the protocol designed by our users.</p><p>We can also illustrate this improved throughput into improved gas requirements by observing the table below:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-hboenxoyknn3j8ikpsipcw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1376\" height=\"542\" srcset=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w600/max/800/1-hboenxoyknn3j8ikpsipcw.png 600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w1000/max/800/1-hboenxoyknn3j8ikpsipcw.png 1000w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-hboenxoyknn3j8ikpsipcw.png 1376w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>In conclusion, we were able to reach an astonishing amount of owasm throughput at 12–20 times faster in Oracle Script</p><p><strong><em>*CAUTION**</em></strong></p><p>As mentioned, in previous versions we injected the consume gas function directly into wasm script. This means that once BandChain is upgraded to v. 2.4 we will need to re-deploy existing oracle scripts. Otherwise, they may consume more gas as shown below.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-cvt2u5aaevok22gzki4qcq.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1118\" height=\"584\" srcset=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w600/max/800/1-cvt2u5aaevok22gzki4qcq.png 600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w1000/max/800/1-cvt2u5aaevok22gzki4qcq.png 1000w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-cvt2u5aaevok22gzki4qcq.png 1118w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><hr><h3 id=\"other-upgrades-to-the-bandchain\"><strong>Other Upgrades to the BandChain</strong></h3><blockquote><strong>“Improved functionality with an additional suite of features that help to make the chain more well-rounded”</strong></blockquote><p><strong><em>Fully Support Statesync</em>: </strong>this new feature will help developers set up new nodes on the BandChain more easily.</p><p>This newest iteration of the BandChain will have an added extension of snapshot that syncs our Data Sources (DS) and Oracle Script (OS) files at the sync state. This was not possible previously and we did not fully support statesync across the nodes since our DS and OS files were not included in the state.This ultimately allows new validators to join the Band ecosystem more easily and seamlessly.</p><p><strong><em>IBC V3</em>: </strong>further consolidation of our oracle price feed in the Cosmos Ecosystem.</p><p>Our upgraded IBC version from V1 to V3 allow CosmWasm contract from other chains to request our price oracle directly through Cosmos IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication).</p><p><strong><em>ICA (InterChain Account)</em>: </strong>the BandChain will now support the InterChain account standard, therefore allowing users to send transactions from other networks via IBC.</p><p>In this upgrade, we have added the InterChain account host module onto the BandChain.

After months of collaboration and hardwork between the team members from Desmos and Band, we are finally able to utilize Band Protocol’s data sources and oracle scripts and allow Desmos users to connect their profiles from traditional centralized Web2 social media networks. This latest accomplishment is a major milestone that will help to shape the revolutionary movements that envisage a more democratic and decentralized social media that ultimately enhances the overall user experience.</p><p>Desmos Profile is an anonymous decentralized identity across various blockchains. This concept is similar to that of Google single sign-on, but now built on Web3. The first products that Desmos Network revealed during this year’s Cosmoverse epitomizes the growing demand for a shift in social media networks from Web2 to Web3. These products include <a href=\"https://beta.scripta.network/?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Scripta</a>, a decentralized publishing platform that operates similarly to Medium, and Butter, a simplified Web3 social media for non-crypto users. In the future, an array of new products will be developed and we are delighted to support the talented pool of developers from the Desmos community as well as play a part in movements that transition Web2 to Web3.</p><blockquote><em>“Band plays a crucial role in the process that allows Desmos users to link their profile to centralized social networks. Thanks to its oracles, we are able to fetch the cryptographic proofs posted on Web2 social networks, and use those proofs to connect their Desmos profile to such accounts in a truly decentralized way. This verification system is particularly useful for users that want to avoid having other people impersonating their account. By connecting their Web2 social identity to their Desmos profile, they can guarantee their followers that such profile is truly theirs and not a fake one.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- Lorenzo from Desmos Network</em></blockquote><p>Earlier this year in March, Desmos launched the Desmos Grant Program which grants users and developers that wish to contribute to the Desmos community access to support for building tools, applications, and products on Desmos. With the goal of bringing as many teams as possible closer to developing on its network, stable versions of DesmJS and GraphQL endpoints were released. This fundamentally gives traditional Web2 developers a smoother transition into Web3 development and thus greatly widens the pool of talented developers that wish to contribute to the development of Desmos Network. By the end of June, the Desmos team completed all the Desmos core modules necessary for a social media network, as well as delivered full support to CosmWasm.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2023, the network will look to not only support the current pool of developers but also onboard new developers that can help grow the Desmos community. From the Band Protocol team, we are looking to provide any support for developers that wish to utilize Band’s oracle scripts to verify not only users between Web2 and Web3 but also between Web3 social media across various blockchains.</p><hr><p><strong><em>About Desmos Network</em></strong></p><p>Desmos Network is a Cosmos SDK based layer 1 blockchain specifically designed to build decentralized social networks.

The fundamental improvements that were made to the BandChain have not only allowed the network to function more efficiently but have also opened up the opportunity for the Band ecosystem to move closer towards one of our goals, which is to operate and contribute to Web3 in the most decentralized manner. Let us now run through our latest proposal and explain why and how this latest gas proposal on the BandChain will be beneficial for the entire Band ecosystem.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://www.cosmoscan.io/proposal/10?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Proposal</strong></a></p><p>The team has suggested that we introduce network fees on the BandChain mainnet as we strongly suggest validators to set the minimum gas price at 0.0025 uband. This change aims to achieve the following objectives:</p><ul><li>Prevent spam events on the BandChain</li><li>Provide incentive for actors to be good actors within the Band community (e.g. validators and data providers to be rewarded for completed work)</li><li>Progress towards a self-sustainable decentralized ecosystem</li></ul><hr><p><strong>How is this beneficial?</strong></p><p>Having made significant improvements to the throughput of the BandChain from the <a href=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/bandchain-v2-4-upgrade/\">latest 2.4 upgrade</a>, the next top-of-mind task in the pursuit to improve security of the BandChain is to introduce gas fees to prevent spam transactions on the BandChain. This minimum gas price, set to 0.0025 uband, came as a result of experimentation and testing that aims to adequately discourage attacks and network spamming whilst simultaneously operating efficiently with no hindrance to the services on the network.</p><p>Implementing this proposal will also allow the Band ecosystem to naturally govern and reward the various actors within the Band community by rewarding these transaction fees to those who positively contribute to the network. Essentially, this proposal not only creates greater emphasis on the value of contributing to the network, but also inherently promotes greater value to the Band token that governs the Band ecosystem.</p><p>Last but not least, implementing this proposal will help to drive our network and community to achieve the goal of a self-sustainable decentralized ecosystem.</p><hr><p><strong>Consequence of not implementing minimal gas fees</strong></p><p>Given the scenario that only some validators choose to implement minimum gas, validators could potentially earn less rewards from transactions on the network given the absence of gas. Therefore, this will impact the innate ability of the BandChain to automatically reward validators who positively contribute to the network. Furthermore, failing to introduce gas could impose potential risk from malicious actors on the network to congest the network with spam transactions that create no positive intrinsic value to the network.</p><p>Efforts to achieve the long-term goal of a self-sustainable decentralized ecosystem will arguably be greatly hampered if we fail to implement this proposal as it aims to automatically create value and reward the participants in a manner that also promotes the utility of the Band token.</p><hr><p><strong>When?</strong></p><p>The deadline for voting <a href=\"https://www.cosmoscan.io/proposal/10?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">this proposal</a> is on the 27th of January and, if the proposal passes, foundation nodes will set a minimum gas price of each node to 0.0025 uband, starting from the 1st of February 2023.</p>\n            ",

This quiet, uninterrupted, and undisturbed time is precisely when all the work happens and it was exactly that at Band Protocol. We have been developing and building steadily amidst the market outlook. This was the time we stepped back and reassessed the industry and the market opportunities as a whole, as we reflected on where we have come from and made a steadfast plan for where we will go.</p><p>The past year has also made an emphasis on just how underserved the market really is, with continuous streams of builders and projects being developed in the Web 3 space in the hopes to advance the frontiers of this industry — it solidified our vision to become a leading web-3 enabler, and in providing Oracle solutions for all. This has resulted in launching our second product under the Band BuilderVerse umbrella, namely Band VRF, in 2022.

On top of increasing security on the BandChain by discouraging spam attacks, this will also allow the Band ecosystem to naturally govern and reward the various actors within the Band community, by rewarding fees to those who positively contribute to the network. Essentially, this does not only create a greater emphasis on the value of contributing to the network, but also inherently promotes greater value and utility of the Band Protocol network.</p><hr><h3 id=\"2023-plans-and-roadmap\">2023 Plans and Roadmap</h3><p>2023 has a lot in store for Band Protocol and our community. The top-of-mind developments, product improvements and key roll-outs will serve the 5 key goals below:</p><ol><li><strong>Security:</strong> As security is paramount to us, this will always remain the number one top-of-mind priority. We have planned multiple on-going efforts to ensure the smooth running of our products</li><li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> In 2022, IBC has really paved the way and enabled Band Protocol to increase interoperability between different blockchain networks. This year, we have plans to roll out three new products that will take this to another level</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Even after the recent BandChain upgrade, Band Protocol will continue to improve and introduce more scalability solutions to enable our oracle network to handle a larger volume of data requests</li><li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Band Protocol is committed to increase the decentralization of our network by working with our community and onboarding more validators and oracle node operators</li><li><strong>Adoption:</strong> There are several ways in which we plan to increase the adoption of our platform. One of which is to explore collaboration with companies in a variety of industries across multiple products. Others include increasing utility and therefore the intrinsic value of the protocol’s network</li></ol><p>In line with what we communicated in the beginning of 2022, the Band Protocol team has embarked on the mission to build a universe of high-quality development tools for Web3 builders to serve the developer community. For the year 2023, we will split our product plans into 2 key categories to achieve the 5 key goals stated above.</p><h4 id=\"existing-products-strengthening\"><strong>Existing</strong> <strong>Products Strengthening</strong></h4><p>With credit to the successful launch of the <a href=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/bandchain-v2-4-upgrade/\">BandChain V.2.4</a>, we were able to increase the efficiency and capacity of the BandChain. Coupled with recent expansion and development on the services side, including oracle solutions integration team, multiple new tools and process optimization, our 2023 goal will be to achieve sustainability for the flagship oracle product and apply these learnings to adjacent products, including, but not limited to, the <a href=\"https://bandprotocol.com/vrf?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Band VRF</a>. We will focus on fine-tuning the Band VRF to increase accessibility and ease of use to expand our user base and use cases.</p><h4 id=\"new-product-roll-outs\"><strong>New Product Roll-Outs</strong></h4><p>In addition to strengthening our existing products, we have three new incredible launches up our sleeves to increase interoperability. These products will be open-source and available to the public as we welcome the community to join us and contribute to the betterment of Band Protocol solutions and tech, and to satisfy our vision to be more decentralized. In this sense, we will also be offering grants and rewards and would like to invite our community to stay tuned for this.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-oppyl6zsyar_6enwlz9-bw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1096\" srcset=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w600/max/800/1-oppyl6zsyar_6enwlz9-bw.png 600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w1000/max/800/1-oppyl6zsyar_6enwlz9-bw.png 1000w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w1600/max/800/1-oppyl6zsyar_6enwlz9-bw.png 1600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-oppyl6zsyar_6enwlz9-bw.png 2198w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><ol><li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.bandchain.org/integration-tools/cw-band/introduction.html?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Cw-band</a>: BandChain</strong><br>After the BandChain upgrade to v2.4, developers are able to connect BandChain with the CosmWasm contract on the Cosmos chain through IBC, and request/receive data from the BandChain. However, this required a lot of specific BandChain knowledge so we will launch an official standard library that wasm contract developers can leverage, as well as provide an example contract that uses them, to ensure wasm contract developers can readily connect with the BandChain.</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.bandchain.org/integration-tools/pricefeed-module/introduction.html?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Pricefeed Module</a>: BandChain </strong>Furthermore, for chains in the Cosmos Ecosystem wanting to natively connect with the BandChain via IBC, we will be launching a consumer module that can be easily imported to the destination chain. This module, once imported, will enable the price-feed function immediately making the process of accessing price-feed faster and more seamless. <br><em>* NB. like the Wasm module, Cosmos chains can import the Wasm module to implement built-in CosmWasm (smart contract) system in their chain</em></li><li><strong>BandChain</strong><br>In the same manner that IBC enables Cosmos Ecosystem chains to connect with the BandChain in a decentralized manner, we will launch a product that enables this capability between EVM-compatible chains and the BandChain. This product leverages the bridge contract that we have built and launched in 2022 alongside the Band VRF, and will take the form of a software program that will request data from the BandChain and sends the results of said request along with any associated proof to the destination chain’s contract. We will also be providing an example for developers to refer to when importing this program. In summary, EVM contract developers will be able to configure and use our program to request and receive data directly from the BandChain in their contract in a decentralized manner.</li></ol><p>These new roll-outs will not only increase interoperability and accessibility, making it easier to integrate with the BandChain, but will also give the flexibility to our users (destination chains and protocols) to choose a suitable model to integrate with the BandChain.</p><hr><h3 id=\"closing-remarks\">Closing Remarks</h3><p>All in all, 2022 was a great year for Band Protocol in terms of development and growth despite the news surrounding the industry.

This AMA recap will highlight the key takeaways, specifically the integration of Band Protcol’s oracle script on the Desmos Network and the new use case for Band’s oracle script that was discussed during the AMA with Lorenzo (DevRel Specialist of Desmos Network) and Leonardo (Director of Product at Desmos Network).</p><p><em>For a full recording of this session, please check out the recorded AMA video: </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL4Mru00Xag&amp;ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Link</em></a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1450\" height=\"148\" srcset=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w600/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png 600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w1000/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png 1000w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png 1450w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h4 id=\"questions-and-answers-in-live-ama\"><strong><em>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS IN LIVE AMA</em></strong></h4><p><strong>Q1: (Leon) Could you give us a brief and more in-depth explanation regarding what the Desmos Network is, and what’s the vision here? I personally see Desmos Network as the social hub for the Cosmos Ecosystem, am I correct here?</strong></p><p><strong>Leonardo:</strong> Desmos Network is a protocol to build decentralized social networks. To put it simply, it’s like a set of rules, exposed by different modules, that all the apps built on the top of Desmos have to follow. Each one of these modules takes care of a different aspect of a social network. For example, there’s one for the Desmos decentralized Identity, the Profile module, another for the contents, the posts module, one for the user’s following/follower, the relationships module, and so on.</p><p>About Desmos being the social hub for the Cosmos Ecosystem, I would say not exactly, it’s a broader vision than just being the social hub for the Cosmos Ecosystem, in fact, we are targeting all those users that are concerned with the centralized social network model. So those who want to interact in a platform that advocates values such as freedom of speech, censorship resistance, and a fairer way of monetizing user’s content.</p><hr><p><strong>Q2: (Leon) Leonardo, can you share with us how Desmos Network integrates and uses Band Protocol?</strong></p><p><strong>Leonardo:</strong> The first and one of the core modules to be released with the mainnet launch of Desmos has been the Profile module. The profile module handles the user’s decentralized identity. The user has the possibility to link it with two possible elements: other blockchain wallets and external applications. <strong>Integration with Band Protocol makes it possible to link an application to a Desmos profile.</strong></p><p>How? Let’s take the Twitter account link as an example.</p><p>If a Desmos user wants to link their Desmos profile to their Twitter account, all they have to do is sign (with their Desmos private key) proof of ownership of content (in this case their Twitter handle) and then post this proof on Twitter. Later on, the data sources will use our APIs to get those data and verify their correctness. Once the data has been verified, the oracle scripts will then store it inside the BandChain as proof of connection so that it can be later queried and verified.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1450\" height=\"148\" srcset=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w600/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png 600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w1000/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png 1000w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/max/800/1-ptj_q_ft4-pst2ypmea0jg.png 1450w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"questions-from-the-community\">Questions from the Community</h3><p><strong>Q1: How does the partnership between Band Protocol and Desmos Network support the development of new products such as Scripta and Butter, which exemplify the growing demand for a shift in social media networks from Web2 to Web3?</strong></p><p><strong>Leonardo: The partnership between Desmos and Band helps to create a trustable way with which users can verify their identity and ownership over any kind of account they have, without the need to input personal information in Scripta, Butter, and any other dApp.</strong> This way the problem of impersonification inside Desmos-based dApps drastically decreases, leaving little to no room for scammers to operate as a trusted source to scam users.</p><hr><p><strong>Q2: What are the plans of Desmos Network for 2023 in terms of onboarding new developers and supporting the current pool of developers to grow the Desmos community and utilize Band’s oracle scripts for verification across various blockchains?</strong></p><p><strong>Leonardo:</strong> Desmos’s biggest plan for 2023 is to create new products. After about 3 years of development to bring the protocol to life, we are now just getting started with creating products that enable the onboarding of new users. To make this happen, we have started moving on as many fronts as possible.</p><p>First of all, we as Desmos are building Butter, our first social network for which Leonardo is responsible. I would like to specify first of all that the protocol is open source, so any developer who wants to use it can do so without any limitations or permission. In addition to this, we have started the Desmos Kickstart Program, through which we aim to fund and help projects with social features that are developed using the Desmos protocol. At the same time, we are also getting involved with participation and collaborations at industry events and demonstrations, to make our technology known by the pools of web2 and web3 developers around the world as much as possible.</p><p>At this time, I am happy to say that we are also in contact with two Italian universities to pursue a project throughout 2023, which will see the development of some products in collaboration with teams of students who specialize in software development. <strong>In short, there is a lot of news coming up to grow the use of Band protocol and Desmos Network.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Q3: How does the verification system provided by Band Protocol’s oracles, which fetches cryptographic proofs posted on Web2 social networks, enhance the security and authenticity of Desmos user-profiles and prevent impersonation?</strong></p><p><strong>Leonardo:</strong> The verification system we’ve built thanks to the Band Protocol framework enhances the security and prevents user impersonation. Also, thanks to the fact that the verification process uses both the Desmos chain (the private key) and BandChain (data sources   scripts) to ensure the relationship between a Desmos profile and a third-party app account. No one else besides the actual owner of the profile and a specific third-party app would be able to replicate the signature process, so even if someone registers on Desmos try to impersonate a famous entity or person, it would not be able to cross-verify their identity on any other platform, since they do not own any of their other accounts.</p><hr><p><strong>Q4: How does the partnership between Band Protocol and Desmos contribute to the larger movement toward a more democratic and decentralized social media ecosystem?</strong></p><p><strong>Lorenzo:</strong> The reason why Desmos was born is precisely this: to create a new ecosystem for social media so that they become a more democratic and decentralized communication tool. As Leonardo said earlier, we started with the idea of revolutionizing an entire system. <strong>Band Protocol, having been the first protocol to offer us the specifications we needed and to have interacted with the IBC protocol, was a fundamental element that allowed us to proceed with development quickly and efficiently.</strong> This collaboration has therefore made it possible to lay the foundations for creating a new generation of social networks in which users will be the real owners of their information and will be able to manage it at will, without being exploited by large companies that currently control this market.</p><hr><p><strong><em>About Desmos Network</em></strong></p><p>Desmos Network is a Cosmos SDK-based layer 1 blockchain specifically designed to build decentralized social networks.

As a result, we have shortlisted, prioritized, and decided to develop four potential products starting in the second half of this year; we believe they will add the most value to our ecosystem.</p><p>Additionally, to complement the launches of the two previously mentioned community initiatives, we will introduce another community program dedicated to the <strong>Band Protocol validators</strong>. Thanks to their continued support, we are where we are today. Our aim is to create a strong and stable foundation for our network as we continue to grow.</p><h3 id=\"four-additional-development-plans-added-to-the-product-roadmap\">Four Additional Development Plans Added to the Product Roadmap</h3><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/2023/07/Product-plan.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1600\" srcset=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/Product-plan.png 600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/Product-plan.png 1000w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/2023/07/Product-plan.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Four Additional Development Plans Added to the Product Roadmap</figcaption></figure><p><strong>1. Cross-Chain Bridge</strong></p><p>Band Protocol has developed a working cross-chain bridge for the <a href=\"https://www.bandprotocol.com/vrf?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Band VRF</a> since 2022. With that being said, the bridge has only been used for Band VRF transactions to date. We see an opportunity to further develop this and will dive deeper into the fundamentals before we release the product to the public. In particular, we will revisit the efficiency of performing cryptographic proofs, and explore threshold signature schemes (TSS). We plan to share more details and insights on our findings soon. Our goal is to identify gaps in the market and ways Band Protocol can bridge them (no pun intended), potentially leading to significant efficiency gains.</p><p><strong>2. “Oracle Variant-1”</strong></p><p>Combining our pursuit to expand the BandChain’s and the Band Oracle’s use cases to cater to as many Web 3 developers as we can, we have come up with a prototype idea for “Oracle Variant-1”. Our mission is to deliver faster oracle solutions whilst ensuring scalability and security. The goal of this variant is to operate on a sub-second level in order to support the growing use cases in the DeFi ecosystem. This prototype network has been designed with a smaller set of workers, specifically assigned tasks and low latency communications. This so-called Oracle Variant-1 will be able to support use cases that require super-low latency, such as perpetual trades. This should also assist in making the use of Oracle solutions an industry-standard practice for protocols, thereby solidifying the need for oracles.</p><p><strong>3. Staked Assets Oracle Prices</strong></p><p>Band Protocol's ethos is to challenge ourselves and support Web3 developers as much as possible. Currently, we offer custom price feed services and customization in order to cater to all projects. To go beyond this, we will extend our custom price feed services and expand into the liquid staking world, offering more comprehensive options and customization with symbols such as wBTC, stETH, and stATOM. Our initial pilot will take place in the cosmos ecosystem as we aim to contribute and be part of the group of players actively expanding the usage of the medium of exchange in the cosmos ecosystem.</p><p><strong>4. Proof of Identity and Associations</strong></p><p>BandChain is currently already being leveraged to provide developers a proof-of-identity for their users without compromising privacy. Our vision is to take this a step further and to extend the use of BandChain to provide a security solution. This means we will onboard data sources that include addresses reported due to the Anti-Money Laundering Act/legislation (AML) and addresses associated with exploits. We will bring a complete solution for proof-of-identity while ensuring smooth running operations for protocol developers, whilst maintaining privacy for end-users. Furthermore, Band Protocol will work closely with <a href=\"https://blockpipe.io/?ref=blog.bandprotocol.com\">Blockpipe</a>, a data platform that helps process large amounts of blockchain data, to screen out associated addresses linked with those that are reported. This solution will be the first of its kind and we hope to continue to be at the forefront of innovation for infrastructure solutions for developers in Web3.</p><h3 id=\"upcoming-validator-program-to-complement-existing-community-initiatives\">Upcoming Validator Program to Complement Existing Community Initiatives</h3><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/2023/07/Validator-Program.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/Validator-Program.png 600w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/Validator-Program.png 1000w, https://blog.bandprotocol.com/content/images/2023/07/Validator-Program.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Upcoming Validator Program to Complement Existing Community Initiatives</figcaption></figure><p>Our community is the reason we exist today, with our validators playing a crucial role in securing the Band network. One of our goals is to continuously improve and bring in leading validators globally to join our ecosystem. Above all, we want to welcome community members who have been with us on this journey and wish to become one of our validators. To support this, we are designing a program to bootstrap existing and incoming network validators and will release more details shortly.</p><hr><h2 id=\"closing\">Closing</h2><p></p><p>In conclusion, we are implementing products, programs, and initiatives to increase our support for Web3 projects and cover a growing number of use cases as the industry develops in both breadth and depth. Additionally, we aim to tap into our community and ecosystem for support, both in technical and non-technical aspects, to accelerate our growth.</p><p>Our goal remains the same: to increase the utility of BandChain and help the Web3 industry grows safely.
